Official dispatches ba-ve been received from Vera Cruz confirming the newspaper accounts of victoriesfor the Liberals.The advices received there from England favorableto the recognition of the Juarez Government, which is expected soon w> take place, have, together with Presi- dent Buchanan's recommendation relative to Mexican attairs, hightened the hopes of the Liberals of complete ancc ss, and produced a corresponding depression Snva< the Reactionists. The Mexican Cabinet, how- ever, do not think Jt will become necessary to call for the aid of American troops in the contingency sug- gested by Mr. Buchanan.A number of military men have written to Wash- ington as to the truth "of the report that the Juarez Government has invited" volunteers from the United States but there is no official or any other authority to BxuAaink, nor would they be accepted without the concurrence of OUT Government. The armeU men ¥Whohave gone,andothers who are preparing togo Bouth may have other schemes in view or be in ex- pectation of a call for their services in Mexico.A* the protest of Mr. McLane against the Tacubava massacre met with no response from Miramon, so the protest of the latter against the recognition of the Juarez Government will receive no official notice from our own.The official advkes from Vera Cruz mention nothing about the coming of the French and Spanish fleets. JLooking to the present unsettled condition of Europe,-no interference from that quarter is appreaended. As the report emanated from the French legation, as did tbe former one, it is looked upon here as a part of the policy of Gabriac, (the French, minister), to encourage.she reactionists at the expense of the liberals.A curious state of anairs in the City of Mexico is noticed. Formerly only prominent liberals were in prison there, but now .ultra-reactionists are shnilarlypunished, owing to their respective political opinions.
