They have recently announced sub-to carry it against the better sense of the Con- vention. Some weeks since a similar proceed- ing* originating, no doubt, in the same cause, was attempted in Congress, by Mr. Ash- more, of South Carolina, and, it ia needless to add, was at once scouted by the House.One of the most sacred provisions of the con- stitution is that which declares that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press. In that great palladium of our liber- ties it is laid down in the most positive manner that there shall be no interference with rights which form the keystone of thestructure raised by i tfully than the men who had the destinies of the infant republic in their safekeeping the im- portance, not only of freedom of discussion, but of freedom of publicity in everything not trenching on individual rights. These two conditions were absolutely essential to the choice of proper representatives by the people, but more especially of chief magistrates equal to the responsibilities of a position demanding not only statesmanlike qualities, but patriotism and integrity of purpose. They therefore secured them, as they thought, by such a con- stitutional provioion as would afford the fullest effect to both.AQAJMR 0 * MVBIO snaavo*a euumr,T ffflUTOX,A*BT- Box i n Cox._ OABDKW, Ooraasoa t Wirm-JMiT Uxa.Pope, the fight which is to take place between cite one or two others which mast be Tory Heenan,Benicia'sstal worth bey, and Sayers, the familiar to Means.

If the Albany Regency, under Cassidy, Cagger & Co., has been oo far degraded from the posi tion it held under its originators, thirty years ago, as to be only a nest of miserable party tricksters and political ruffians, the partisan leaders in the city proper cannot complain. They are equally demoralized, equally corrupt, politically, and between Albany, and Tammany, and Mozart Halls, the democratic party in New York has been re- duced to its present dilapidated condition; it is a minorityÑa raging, snarling, biting, snap- ping collection of angry factions, warring over personal feuds while the enemy is at the city gates. What else but de- feat,andshame,anddisgrace,canresult from such a state of things? How can either body of men claiming to represent the de- mocracy of this State have the impudence to go to Charleston and knock at the door of a National Convention? Do they expect that their personal quarrels are to be settled in the grand council of the party? Would they not receive the just punishment due to their politi- cal crimes if they should be shut out of the Convention altogether? One delegation claims "regularity." They are regular only in being regular political scamps, and regularly devoid ofallpublicmorality. Neitherdelegationcan claim to represent the democracy in the Na- tional Convention while the present warfare is maintained.The attacks upon the Hon.

Nor can we be- lieve that this circumstance is attributable solely to the natural depravity of the youth of New York, though it is Incontrovertible that reck- lessness and violence strongly characterize them. It is to be attributed mainly to that spirit of rowdyism and disregard of human life so prevalent amongst us, which leads to barroom fights and the free use of deadly weapons in moments of passion.

These are the men who, for their own selfish and venal purposes, have, from time to time, placed trammels upon the free action of the independent press by excluding it from assemblages called together to discuss ques- tions bearing upon the general interests.For five and twenty years we have battled against this system of party and individual cen- sorship, which, as we have just observed, is far more tyrannical and oppressive than that exer- cised under foreign despotisms, for the latter is based on fixed and understandable princi- ples, while the former is capricious and vindic- tive in its action. From the first moment at which we were able to lay down our course as independent journalists, we resolved that we should restore to that provision of the constitu- tion which proclaims the fullest liberty to the press all the force and value intended to be given to it by ito framors. We have never in anything compromised, and we never shall compromise, the rights and privileges to which we are entitled by it. When we originated the system of publishing financial reports from Wall street, the most absurd and ludicrous outcry was raised against it, and the strongest influences were brought to bear on us to in- duce us to desist We persevered in our plan, notwithstanding all the abuse that was lavished on us. Very soon the other papers began to copy us, and now financial reports are as essential a feature of a newspaper as any other branch of its intelligence. The same desperate opposition was made by the politi- cians to our reporting the proceedings of their caucuses and conventions, but we were not long in demonstrating the uselessness as well as the folly of their resistance. A few years ago we sent a reporter to Virginia to report Governor Wise's speeches, when he was stump- ing the State, and he was assailed and hunted down by the chivalry of the Old Dominion, with the Governor at their head, in a manner that they have, no doubt, since been heartily ashamed of, although Governor Wise has not had the justice to take back the abuse that he heaped upon him. The Richmond Opposition State Convention have, unhappily for them- selves, got into the same kink, and if the re- mainder of their proceedings is to be of a simi- lar character, It may safely be assumed that they will not exercise any very serious influ- ence on the Presidential campaign. As for ourselves, we care nothing about their sentence of exclusion; it will spare us both trouble and expense, whilst all that we desire to learn will reach us through channels that have never failed us on such occasions.RENTS AND REAL ESTATE.ÑThere is very little change, either in the way of increase or decrease, in rents throughout the city, this year fromlastyear. Both rents and thevalue of real estate appear to be pretty nearly stationary on an average. The Central Park has ex- ercised, perhaps, some influence in advancing real estate in that vicinity; but its value has been exaggerated.
