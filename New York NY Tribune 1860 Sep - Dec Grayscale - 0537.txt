LATITUDE. VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND.To the Editor of The N. Y. Tribune.SIR: I perceive that many reports are rife in your section, to the effect that Virginia and Maryland are disposed to follow in the wake of South Carolina, m ber treasonable attitude toward the general Govern- ment.As you are intimately acquainted in both States, and, as I believe, thoroughly conversant with the statÈ of public feeling among the masses, I desire to'assure yoa. that there is not a shadow of ground for Bach reports.The majority of voters in this immediate section were opposed to the election of Mr. Lincoln, it is true; but I hesitate not to say, that ninety-nine out of every hun- dred Bell men in this State and Virginia preferred the election of Lincoln to Breckinridge, and aro determined that, having been elected, he shall be, inaugu- rated. As between the principles of the Re- publican party and those of the secession.wing of the Democratic, no Bell man here is dis- posed toinattitute a comparison. The former, embody- mg as they do those for which the old Whigs have everbattled, naturally appeal to their support, though they were not inclined to advocate, in the last canvass, that particular clause in the Republican Platform which had reference to Slavery. And yet their oppo- sition arose not. so much from a conviction that that - particular clause would bring evil upon the South, as that the election of Bell would tend more certainly to allay this whole excitement upon the subject of Slavery. And many, are now convinced that they were in error, boldly avowing their opinions that Mr. Lincoln will administer the government upon such, wise and patriotic principles as to commend him to the support of patriots everywhere.I have not seen the first Bell man, or rather Whig; who does not ridicule and treat with contempt the threats of Breckinridge men to dissolve the Union be- cause the people have decided that they are unfit to be entrusted with the administration of the Government.For after all, this is the whole secret. Were there' no incumbents to be ousted, no needy adherents to their party to be maintained and no offices to be filled^/ there would be no talk of disunion.They seem to think that they have a life interest in the offices under the Federal Government and shouldbe allowed to bequeath them, and they are exceeding-ly reluctant to indulge any other idea. Weoxe some- what disposed to question such assumption of right, and have so little concern at the fate of these said officialsas not to care when they go, though we sometimes 4a- dulge the hope that seeing ultimately the error of their way, they may resolve to make honest men of theni^ selves, and in some honest and legitimate business-''eji*<M- deavor at least to regain some portion of that gboi character which it is to be hoped they enjoyed previ- ous to their connection with the Democratic party. 'Secession is a humbug, so far as this State and Vir- ginia are concerned. W e don't care one cent about*j ernors, and ambitions stumpers generally, whether.of conscious of the correctness of my conclusions, and of sublimity of this great struggle kindles my imagina- executive and iudicial powers, together with the meansh e r independent condition by the general Government,It docs not'seem that it would be any cause why stocks . should fall and everybody clutch for gold. The seces- sion of a State or two, the dominant feeling being ¥ against coercion, where is the ground to expect a con-flict ? South Carolina would only be let aloue severe- ly, and so also Mississippi, or Alabama. And In a year or so, the people might throw off the trouble ana ex-¥ pense of a separate government by, restoring theirseveral States to the bosom of the old Confederacy.This, we say,might be the case, taking the most, favor-able view,of a ^doubtful question; but the possibilityo r probability of such a finale to actual secession takesnothing from the profound repugnance which all shouldShould Alabama secede from the Union, as I thiuk to God, and patriotism is sublimated into religion!

This conviction found expression in a res- olution of CongresH, adopted Feb. 24,1787, in the fol-lowing words, viz: ' /" liittotved. That in tho opinion of Congress, it is expedient, that on the second Monday in May next, a Convention of Dele- gates who shall have been appointed by the several States, be hold at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpoleof revising, the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congrons and the several Legislatures,-such alterations, and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by tho States, rende^the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigences of Government, and the preservation of tfie Union."There was already, by compact, a " perpetual Union;" and this perpetual Union it was the avowed object of Congress to; preserve, by a revision of the "Federal Constitution.
