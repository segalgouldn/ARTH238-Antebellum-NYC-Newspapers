Reeaming the narrative of New Engjaod affairs from the con-federacy of the four colonies established in 1643, it traoes the course of events through the epoch of the British Commonwealth to the period of the Restoration,andcloseswiththe'arrivalofthe Royai Commissioners in Bo-rton in the year 1664. A large space is devoted to the discussion of o v- temporaneous English history, thus presenting events in their most comprehensive reUtions, and reducing the politics of the colonies, and the prin- ciples and movements on Which they were founded,to a significant unity.In narrating the formation and growth of the primitive institutions of New-England, Mr. Palfrey advances no claim to the impartiality which pro- ceeds from lack of *yrrpathy with the character of their founders, or from indifference to the purposes which formed the life-blood of their enterprise.eion 'of tre best, meth<de of operation, bat ii ititlaed•.••entraj Pa.^ •••Hid ona»; *W»J»on«ttr w . * « * , t e o o t > t - ^*ona of bia oj•eneofthe.K krooze to anch Cetrtr^lP&tk,made, or int*i *»t hi«b.
