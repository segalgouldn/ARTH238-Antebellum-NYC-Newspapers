Mr.' Leutze, we presume, has painted no picture wbrjh will be so popular as this.Thus much in its praise—praise honest ani conscien- tious. There is another criticism, looking at it from another stand-point, which ought not to be omitted, thongh we might hesitate were Mr. Leutze a younger artist. That the Washington of history is a perfectly ideal character is, we suppose, now generally admitted by all sensible people, who very well know that the real life and character of the man is utterly misappre- hended and misrepresented.
