No doubt a good many cattle sold on Wednesday at over ten cents, net/a pound, that were refused at ten upon the first day of the market, which was a rtrj dnll day throughout, while yester- day^after the severe cold of the morning had softened, was a pretty lively day, and the yards began to show empty at an early hour in the afternoon, and were all clear before night. W e don't know when w e have seen- the drovers look so jolly as they did about the close of the market. Tne advance of price is gener- ally attributed to a somewhat short supply of cattle for tie last two weeks. The number, and where they came from, and the prices, can be seen in the Cattle Market report.Mrs. Ellen K«y Blunt wilt, by request, repeat her Poetical Readings before tbe Mercantile Library Asso- ciation, at Clinton Hall, this evening.
