From the 21st to the 23c there we/e few incidents of any conseqtwnce, either on this or on the Sicilian side. A lout 4 o'clock in the al.ernoon of the 22d the town of Messira was alarmed by a succession of cannon shotsleone, if even there. The surrender yesterday showed tbeepiritoftheNeapolitanarmyinanewlight. It was, as nearly as possible, defection in mass. Thus the whole country behind Calabria Citeriore and Basil- i^ata is up; tbey have proclaimed the Dictatorship of Garibaldi, and have put themsel res iu communication with headquarters. Verily it is high time that King Francis should think of embarking.Garibaldi has addressed the following proclamation to the people of the Neapolitan continent:" The opposition of the »ta.»gers Interestedin our .humiliation and internal factions have impeded Itahr from constituting her- self | --•.hence. Fewherebelieveinherdeclarations; but thereareverymanywhobelievethatHungary will compel her to be, at least for the present, more prudent than is her wont.'•-' SYRIA.It was again asserted that Christians had beenmac sacred at Baal bee and in a.village near Jean d' Acre.An emeute had taken place at Sieruona, and a more serious one was apprehended at Phillipuhoboli.Agitation continued to prevail in Bosnia and theHaizegovina, but the Sultan had ordered the Grandlicanpartygotinpowertheycouldreducetheexpense of the government.After another song by the. Glee Club, the chairman introduced Mr. HEGE.MAN, who said that the history of the world showed that if the power of Government was placed in ihe hands of one man, it tended to des- potism. And if Power was dangerous in the hands of one man,itwasstillmoresointhehandsofacorrupt factiob. The D^mocraiicparty, the most corrapt partythat ever stained the annuls of any country, wasdes- tintd io go out of power. H e believed that the party was once a liberty party, but it has ceased to be such. The best evidence that tne party was goingto die was its looking around for foreign aid. Sir.,H. criticised Douglas and his principles severely, and showed the incoiifcifrtency of his record.THOMAS G.
