As tbe mother of a large' familyaad aa a constitutional sovereign, her sway has bean slfke mild and enlightened—lirm, yet conciliatory: and the re- caption which too Prince of wale* in one part of her do- minions has experienced, and her second son, Prince Alfred, ia another sad mere distant part, may bo traced to the respect and affection wh ch are everywhere felt for tbe person of tbe Queen. Duriag her reign which now ex- tends over nearly toe fourth o' a century, toe British Court has been a modtl of purity and refinement, aad stands out in string contrast with the example set by seme of the sovereigns of her own house, and the effect upon toe manners and morals of the aristocracy of our own time msy be saht to have permeated all elans* and condi- tions of life.
