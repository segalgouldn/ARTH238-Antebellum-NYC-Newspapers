The advantages which this road will have over any others now known are, first, it* is the nearest route to all the mining districts from the eastern slope of the moun- tains to the western slope, and to the mines on the weBt. It is also the nearest route from the States, and will be better than any other road known. Its advan- tages as a stage route, over the South Pass, and that of theElPasoroute,Texas,are,first,weha\$lessmoun- tain road, not half so much enow, and a settled coun- try, which will afford protection to the mails; and the continual travel over this will always keep it open, s> that the dangers of detention, freezing of animals and men, do not exiet here as on the other routes.
