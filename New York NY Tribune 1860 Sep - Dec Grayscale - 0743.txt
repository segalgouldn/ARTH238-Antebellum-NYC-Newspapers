This question must have a VIOLEST or a PEACBFCL solution. It* mighty import will bp appreciated when we reflect that tbe con- sequences resulting from the former alternative are most to be* dreaded! W e should do all that can be done, In the way of jus- tice equity, conciliation and forbearance, to avert a conflict, out if all efforts in that direction prove fruitless. It is better to rebuke- Treason, enforce the Laws, and preserve the Union, cost what it may, thnn suffer its Dismemberment.But it is asked, what cm done? This question can be best na- Rwered •when the popular mind t»nes down surHciently to be will- ing that anything should be done. W e are prepared to say that an efficient, but not revolting. Fugitive Slavolaw should be passed, and that its passage should be followed by a repeal of Persona? Liberty laws. We arc almost prepared to say, that Territories may be safely left to take care of themselves; and tliat, when they eon- tain a population which, under the census, entitles them to agresentative in Congress, they may come into the Union wittt tate Governments of their own framing, provided, of course, that they conform to tbe Constitution of the United State*. This, in view of the surroundings of the Territory belonging to the Re- public :in view of the fact that for fonr years.at least. Fre-Mi»m will hove f»ir play; and in view, also, ot two other elements—Emigra- tion and tho Census—this, we say, almost constrains us to believe that we may now confide the future of the T en itoriea to the in- telHgenee and patriotism of those who ore to inhabit them.47 25'• .NJ.
