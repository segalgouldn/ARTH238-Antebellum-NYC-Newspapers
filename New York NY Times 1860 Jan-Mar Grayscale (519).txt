This wassubmitted to Count Rzchbero on thelHh of December last, and was instant-[independenceI-with horror, with the excla- mation that " any Austrian Minister who ven- ttned to propose such a thing would desenre to be tried for Jiigh treason." As for a power like Austria, whose actaal phytical strength isso sadly disproportioned to iff bulk, and whose very existence is to so large an extent dependent on the forbearance of its neighbors, nothing is of so much importance as having, if not abstract right, at least legal precedent on its side, the folly of Bkchbibo's scornful repudiation of the doctrine of popu- lar sovereignty is, at this jsncture, very app^ent, in view of the historical fact that within forty years Austria has in four instances given it the strongest practical recognition. She acknowledges theof Greece, of the Sooth Ameri- can Bepublics, of Belgium, and last of all tbe legality of the present French Empire. The ttatus quo, in each of these cases, is based on the popular will, a mode of arbitrament which, in the case of Italy, the Austrian Minister de- clares it to be treasonable for him even to contemplate. If the principle of legitimacy be as sacred a Couni Bxchbxkg represents it to be, thirty years la certainly not enough to make downright rebellion fit for the notice of such an imcommonlylegitimate family as the Hapsburgs ; and if it betreason for an Austrian Miaister to agree thata nation sboidd elect its own ruler in foreignits own way, whi^ are we to call breakfasting with,andfratemMngwith, thehighpriest of high treason, Louis Napoleoh himself?The reservation of the right to resort to force, in esse of ne~eessity, coming close after this extraordinary declaration of sentiment oni FarUament had l>een interesting.
