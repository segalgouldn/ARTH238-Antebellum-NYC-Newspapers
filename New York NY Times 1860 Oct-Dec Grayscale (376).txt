And like •Mueqaences might have followed here had not .the. action of yesterday reversed the feeling of centraction to one of prompt and liberal expansion.Our inquiries at the principal banks lead us to.tte coDclnsion that their creditors have not availed•f the invitation to help themselves freely toBfUUH, and that their debtors are less pressingAan yesterday to make preparations for or re-—wsl nf lliiiii iiiodiiiini obligations. The assur- .^nee is now felt by the latter that they wiU be ac-•GBBDOdated most liberally, come what may, and ;if tite former be not satisfied with this policy, from -any distrust they may feel in the general sound- jwss of the trade of the City facilitated through tke-Btibks, they are still asked to help themselvesSaih« Specie for their deposits.Thursday is not a regular Discount day with;^miyofthelargeBanks.
