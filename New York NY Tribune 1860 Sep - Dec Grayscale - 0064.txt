It does not even consst in the r'gbt of the people to teaee Slavery out of a Terri- tory ; it cor sihts in the power of a Territorial Lecriala- ture, coupled w^h the duty to pass acts for the protec- tion of Slavery, but by no means against it. The as- BUtxed power to paes.unfriendly laws seems to be cbansed into the duty to pass friendly laws. I call this Popular Sovereignty with a vengeance!
