Yesterday, by the action of tbe Croton Aquedact Committee of tho Board of Aldermen, this •natter was settled in fa- vor of immediate improvements. I t appears that while building the High Bridge, 20 years ago, large quanti- ties of stones, earth, and timber wore put ia«o the river,formingwhatisnowknownas theOld Coffer Dams, for the purpose of facilitating the erection ofthe bridge, and that these coffer dams have never been re- moved.The action of the water upon them h a * earned off much of the earth, and scattered it along tbe euannel up to Kingfcbridge, making it crooked, and doing it outer injury. Lewis G. Worm and others were pres- ent,petitioningforthe removal ofthese obstructions. Tbe petition had been before the Board of Supervisors, and was sent to the Common Council, with the re tuark that "thecLai_ was a ju«t one, and should be adjusted by tbe Common Council." on the ground that it was within the jurisdiction of the city._«wt between t h e Bondholder* o f tbe CHICAGO.
