But we must respect constitutions, obey law, and recognize the rights, of the greatest number, or political society itself will fail into dissolution. If the few must not be sacrificed to the many, it is even more true that tho many must not'be sacrificed to the few. We must maintain government, or chaos is come again.Whether ours can bear the strain that is about to be put upon it time must determine. The force of a great Government based on popular rule, consulting only the greatest good of the greatest number, both; theoretically and practi- cally, must be prodigious when honestly exerted for self-preservation. If we cannot confide in in that power, thero is nothing human we can confide in. And as tho whole is strong, so must rebellious parts be correspondingly weak.
