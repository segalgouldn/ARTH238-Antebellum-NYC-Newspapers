These, nicely laid down to grass, serve as turning places, and for road- ways, aud may be annually mowed. Toey serve t o keep the fence-row free of weedeand bushes. Where the lields are kvrge, and more than one kind of crop is planted, a roadway should always be left through the field, and even in fields of Indian corn, such roadways will be found extremely convenient, and a great saving of labor, as a team can drag a full load upon Buch a road at times when an empty wagon would be a heavyload on plowed ground.—There was a very large meeting of Republicans a*from the Bceneelof this occasion without a good hope for the future of a people which is still BOloyal to the, domestic viitues that have made the name of Victoria illustrious; and this sentiment of respect and admira- tion f o r purity and charity was the key-note of the whole affair.The smoke of the Harriet Lane was Been rising overthe Narrows to a eky not wholly clear, but patchedwith bright October blue; and her coming was hailedwith the roaia of guns from the forts, and from vesselsthe soldiers, were a goodly eight, may be the extent of our Jenkinsism; The effect of• the statuesque columns with presented arms, of the gorgeous strains of Gol- Save the Queen, rolling in sublime eddies round and round the field, and echoing from the trees of the Bat- tery and the houses on the streets, aud of the cheeriog crowds tbat lined the incloeure,is not so easily dis- missed.
