Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and has been Implanted in the heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purpose; and no political union, however fraught with blessings and benefits in BB other respects, canlong continue, if the necessary consequence be to render the homes and the firetddes of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly inseeure.

It is altogether founded upon inference, not from any language con- tained in the instrument itself, but frOm the sovereign character of the several States by which it was ratified. But is it beyond the power of a State, like an indi- vidual, to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to se- cure the remainder ?
