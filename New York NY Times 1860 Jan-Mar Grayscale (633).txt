Ishall now restrict myself to a discussion of the Northern frontlsr, the central or California Northern route which my pamphlet advocates, and the extreme Southern route. Tbe line of the thirty-fifth parallel, sometimes termed tbe central, need not be bronght into the present dis- coision. Too far santh to be regarded as coming within tha limit of the term central, if adopted as the single line to Ihe Pacific, It completely ignores the claim of Oregon and Washington to a branch road.Neither as the single line is it the one chosen by the people of the Pacific Coast assembled la coave&tlon. It iha; seem bard to explain the remark you have heard attributed to me, tbat I believed the Texan or extreme southern railroad should receive more aid than the central or Platte Valley route, but I think not.The only difficulty Is tbat the subject may lead one into a statement of some lenatb.
