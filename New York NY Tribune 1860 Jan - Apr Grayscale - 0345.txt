Mr. Milliken said he did not desire to make the acquaintance of Mr. Allen. The latter gen- tleman insisted, and Mr-Milliken still declined, re- marking that he would have nothing, to do with Allen till after he should withdraw certain charges which he had made reflecting against his (Milliken'e) character and integrity. The charge referred to,[it is understood, was that Mr. Milliken was the author.{of the celebrated letter whfch had been eeen in Wall street, suggesting that $100,000 would be required to defeat Pro Kata.Mr. Allen admitted that he had beard it insinuated that Mr. Milliken was the author of the letter referred to, and that he had repeated the rumor. Mr. Milliken further expressed his disinclination to form the ac- quaintance of Mr. Allen uotil this cbargo should be withdrawn, and- intimated his decided opinion that he was a slanderous scoundrel.
