The process of ripening has cone ou at a rapid rate, and much grain now ttand* ID shocks in the fi«ld«, with every proa-Sect 01 its being gathered to moderate condition. More haste, owever. than was desirable has already been evinced to bring- ing tbe new wheat to market, the condition being mostly too bad for milling purposes, wi'.h weights varying from, 56 pounds and leas per bpihel to 63 pounds; but this test weight! is rare. As a whole, the crop seems likely to turn out much better than w u expected, and this i« the case with other grain; but no improve- ment can be reported as to the state of potatoes, either in this country or abroad. It is well that foreign imports of w h e t havolately been literal, as the stock ol old English is much below tho required quantity for mixing: and as both the yield as well a« quality is like.v to be under an average, ther* must be a continu- ous demand. Nevertheless, should the new produce be forced on markets, a temporary depression is very probable.

Your jurisdiction, except as to the discharge of parents, and the arrest of inmates eloping from the Quarantine enclosure, visiting the sic* in the hospitals for a definite purpose, and the arrest of persons for violation of Quarantine orders or regulations"., is con- fined to the water; and while the Commissioners of Emigration always desire to presume that the persons to whom you gr»nt permission to enter the Quarantine grounds are of the class wnhin your province, they are forced to a different conclusionwhen your permits are issued to persons who, although dis- charged as employees of the Commissioners, persist in asserting that they continue in their employment, and undertake to act as BUChonthe premises upon which, against the positive directions ol tbe Commissioners; they intrude, under cover of permission from you to pass the gate. The Commissioners are also obliged to withhold this presumption when you undertake to exercise actsofownershipovertheirproperty,by converting the Quar- antine station into a parade ground for political clubs.The Commissioners of Emigration, while they have no desire and have never attempted to interfere with the discretion rested to you as a btate Officer, consider that such discretion i* not without Its limits, and that in asserting that you will admit into the Quarantine inclosure, not only those whom legitimate busi- ness may call there, but whomsoeverjou deem proper to admit and to carrying out that assertion by deeming it proper to admit and admitting those whose only object to going upon the grounds, consists as you know, to a desire to defy the Commissioners and!HjtMindThe grandest show or spectacle that ever was de-vised becomes wearisome to the spectator after a con- tkraous view of four hoars. Considering the usoal .-• -want of punctuality in starting and the usual halts on the route, nearly all spectators have secured their pi&ees and been in waiting an hour or two before, the procession arrives; add four hours for its passage to this, and the limit of sight-seeing endurance is reached.Iffew we would suggest th4t for the route of this great Wide-Awake parade only ihe wideststreets be chosen, 'Wherein the torch-bearing army can march twenty-five7iimittee.000 fund for this object ?

My Dear Sir: .I intended.to have had a personal interview with you yesterday, in reference to the unpleasant occurrences at the Quarantine during the past few days, but was prevented by the urgency of ether duties. I regret exceedingly that theCommissioners of Emigration have seen fit to adopt a course with regard to the passage of persons throngh the Quarantine grounds which must inevitably create great dissatisfaction in the public mind, destroy the friendly feeling toward the Institution which it has been my uniform effort to'cultivate, and lead, perhaps, < ventually, to some hostile demonstration.

We would suggest to the Committee that carts or other depositories of these pyrotechnics be placed along the route of the procession, and the distri- bution, be made so that the display may take plaoe with equal brilliancy throughout the entire line of march.. It sometimes happens in torchlight parades that the supply of fireworks is .early exhausted, and the parade toward its close is shorn of much of its splendor. We would earnestly caution the Wide-Awakes; while dis- charging Soman candles as they march, not to direct them toward the houses on either side. J>uring the torchlight parade of the Atlantic Cable celebration ladies were driven from windows and balconies by showers of fire-balls recklessly rained down upon them or fired directly at them from Soman candles in the hands of the marching firemen.In Paris when a celebration is to take place the first movement is the appointment of a committe of artists to devise andfcoBstruct the decorations. The plan is worthy of imitation. W e have not heard that the Committee design any great novelty in the way of illumination of buildings or erection of arches; but as this celebration is participated in by the Wide-Awakes of the Union upon the invitation of the Clubs of this city, we would suggest that the erection of a grand illuminated triumphal arch in honor of the visitors would be appropriate. The carpenters, painters, gas- fitters, etc., belonging to the New-Tork Wide-A wakes would doubtless give their services gratuitously, leav- ing only the cost of materials to be met by the Com-of which we purpoee to* speak, the great majority will be surprised to learn that there are new kinds which bid fair to run their favorites from the market.Vineyardists recognize two kinds of grapes, which are ss separate and distinct in their properties and value as can well be imagined. 'There*is one family whose sweet and luscious fruit is fit only for the table; while the other, whose juice may be said to possess a high de- gree of acidity overcome with a higher degree of sugar and agreeably flavored with arbmatics, is the trde wine- grape of the world. The former, of which the sweet-juiced Chasselas de Fpntainebleauma. type,'is termed " feeble flavored;" while the latter, represented by the Catawba, Diana, Isabella, and a host of others, is deBig' nated as "vinous'' and "sprightly." The juice ofthe Sweetwater* a foreign grape of the Chasselas fam- ily, is described in the very name of the variety, and is nothing but sugar and water, with some mucilage added, and soon palls upon the taste of the eater. Let any one who wishes to see the best collection of Amer- ican seedling grapes ever grown in this eity go to the Horticultural show at Palace Garden, and be convinced of the truth of what we say. There, in close,juxtapo- sition, they will see Isabellas and Catawbas, and a score of other .varieties, a mere handful, it is true, of the hundreds which are known to nurserymen, but Btill embracing all or nearly all the kinds recommendedpioceeded to explain this apparent incompatibOity in religious matters in general; and said it was rather an argument in favor of religion, than against it.

In regard to this batter firm, of the world. Bishop Smith was called to ocoupy aing taxed to gather tbe grain, albeit sometimes unripe and sprouted. Things had gone so far to the bad that the eccleeiastical dignitaries were making arrange* ments for a national fast and supplication to God for sonie alleviation of their distress; and among the poorer classes the prospect of suffering and famine Jwaa becoming painfully certain. Bat at hist the weather- glass pointed to fair weather, and at once the public, like a condemned criminal who. obtains a respite, gave way to the most exuberant joy. There are not want* ing, either in England or this country, shrewd specu- lators who, wishing to make their hay daring this4 son of sunshine, spread exaggerated reports ol prospective yield of crops. With the view of knocking prices down to their utmost limit, they tell us that Ea, gland will give at least a full average grain harvest, and perhaps something more. Bat, while we are ever anxious to take a conservative view of things, and, ia aBritishseasonsoexceptional ae thishas beentoall rule and precedent, are prepared to admit almost any- thing in reason, it is against all common sense to be- lieve that a fall average crop can be harvested after going through the terrible vicissitudes it has this year. The jield may be tolerably fair, but when we get ac- counts of grain sprouting, rotting on the ground, stricken vkh rust and blight, laid, and sodden, with water, as we have for a month past, we are not .pre- pared, to admit the glittering prospect which the op- timists hold out. The London Economist takes the same view of the case, and uses this language:" A period of dry weather, extending now from Thursday, the 30th of August, • has considerably improved the farmers'pros- pects, and it is found tbat thongh the gra<n has not this year ri- pened in due season, stil) it ha» ripened, and should we have a dry September, the sreater part of Our grain crops wfll be se-full nve woeks later than that of" act year, and at least threo we eks more backw ard than to seasons wMch are not considered early. As is commonly the case where past apprehensions havo .been partially rellev-d, opinion goes into the opposite extreme : predictions that the crops will not fall below the average, ana statements that they are better than last year's crops are freely hazarded W e availed ourselves of two days at Barnet Fair tot compare the statements of farmers and others from differentSarts of the country, with each other, and with our own mora mited observati. n The genera results seem to be these: On. the very dry soils the gravels and the sands, which commonly suffer from want 0/ moisture to ordinary Summers, tbe crop* are said to be unusually abundant. One farmer, occupying sandy land in Leicestershire, told us that his corn crops had never been so good, and tbat bis roots exceeded anythinE he had beforerbvext able to grow. In Bedfordshire, from-the reports of occupiers of similar soils, the crops are very good On chalk and other light soils ofa character less thirsty than those we have before referred.to, the plant ia often thin, and, although the ears are full, they are generally short and not thick-set as to seasons when we havo a happier combination of rain and sunshine than w o have experi- enced dnrtox the past Spring and Summer.

It appears that the early white wheats, of which large quantities have appeared to Mark lane, are more sprouted than was generally believed; and it seems that the grain of the wh«at crop, is considerably riper than the 'green condition of the straw would. Indi- cate-; consequently many farmet* began to reap when, ac- cording to ordinary observation, the crop was far too green. This, however, will render it necessary to keep the wheat longer to the field than in ordinary seasons: and the unusual growth af weeds, even on the best fanned lands, will also delay t»« carry- ing of the crops. These circumstances increase the anxiety of fa. mers for the continuance of the present dry weather. Pea* and beans are large crops, though the beans are not corned at all in proportion to the bulk of straw, while peas h«ve remained so long to tbe field from constant wet that tney are much injured, and much ef the crop shed on the ground. As regards roots, the turnips are good on dry Und. but on the strong soils there was a> difficulty both to preparing tbe land and afterward in sowing the seed, while the hoeing of the root crops, even where a plant baa been obtained, has been extremely ineffective. Mangold wurt- zel, save on the very dry soils, is very bad the plants,' even where clean, making little or no progress, so that heavy weights cannot be generally grown this year though the Autumn should prove dry and fin*, where Summer fallows ate made the lanltion of the State Assessors for the same year, with their revisions for the year 1860.
