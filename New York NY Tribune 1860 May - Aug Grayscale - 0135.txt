Either the Convention must rest satisfied with denying any power in Congress to interfere with Slavery in the Territories, or it must come up to the ultra South- ern mark of insisting upon a Congressional slave code. It must choose between throwing aside all chance of carrying any Northern State and the' final secession of a certain number of its ultra Southern adherents.Even after the question of a platform is settled, there, remains the still greater difficulty—lying at the bottom in fact of the trouble about the plat- form-—of agreeing upon a candidate. It will be found even more difficult to dispose of Mr. Douglasthan it is to dispose of Squatter Sovereignty.and his friends will cling to the nomination with no less tenacity than he himself shows in clinging to the party in spite of all attempts to shake him off. The steady front which his adherents showed at Charleston, and the airs which he now begins to assume in the Senate of one entitled to speak for the party, indicate as little disposition to yield upon this point as upon that of the platform. We do notfindinMr.Douglas's speechanyintimationof a readiness to yield hispersonal claimBfor the sake of harmony. When he speaks with such decis- ion about his determination not to be read out of theparty, he seems to intimate at the same time a resolution not to be shuffled out of the candidacy. Hitherto Mr. Douglas has had to struggle against all the weight of Executive influence brought to bear against him. His success, notwithstanding, in securing so strong a party in the Convention, gives him now a power, in view of the future, quite equal to that of the Executive itself. On the other hand, the secessionists appear to have gone too far to yield. With Douglas, or a nominee of Douglas, as President, they would have little to expect.stop the hurrahs.
