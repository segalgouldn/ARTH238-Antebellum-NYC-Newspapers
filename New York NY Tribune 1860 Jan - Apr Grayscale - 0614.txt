The 'ast hours of the session were in perfect keeping with the character of the controlling powers of the Legislature, inteneified by more than the usual amount of internal excitements. The commotions of the privi- ous two orthree days—the anxieties and chagrin of the Camden and Amboy monopolists and their confederates, were great at the foreshadowed defeat of their project, the New-Brunswick and Milburn road (twin brother to that of Hoboken). The resolution directing the Attorney-General to institute legal proceedings againstthe Joint Companies for not complying with law, by makingthedoubletrack,straighteningtheircurves, and increasir-g the rapidity and safety of their trains, for which they had received large considerations from the State, and the general indignation, of the friends of thepeople'srailroads,whichhadbeendefeatedbythe Assemblybyonlytwovotes—these,withtheusual incidents and schemes of lesser magnitude, involved the closing scenes of the House in great commotion. Two gentlemen who left the Assembly room about 10 o'clock a t night, remarked, that there "had never been puch a House before at Trenton, all things being in15,000 Missouri State 6s.... 80£ 120 Mh.
