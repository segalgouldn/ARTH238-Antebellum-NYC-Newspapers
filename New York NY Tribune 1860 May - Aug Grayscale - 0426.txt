ThedrfferencebetweenhimandOushing(inpoint. of character, I mean) is, that Cushing is a man of had principles, and Hallett a man totally without principles.<Dr.Loring,whohasdistinguishedhim- »elf by a speech at Baltimore, is a man of the same •tamp as Hallett, but apparently without any of fialiett's amiablequalities.
