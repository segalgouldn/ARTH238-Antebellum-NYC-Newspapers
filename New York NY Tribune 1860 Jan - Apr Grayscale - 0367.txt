It is, moreover, a political fault of the American Govern- ment. . Who can fore >ee the results of tbis immolation ? Who can tell what will come to the United States, and especially to the Carolinas and Virginia, who shed this generous blood, notwithstanding all divine laws, the tears of a wife, and the cries of all Europe for mercy." For ns Hay tians, w e do not wish -to return evil for evil, and we hope that tho blood of this glorious mar- tyr will not rise up against his execution ws. We pr*y God to open their eyes and soften their hearts, and while waiting tho happy day of the regeneration of an enslaved brethren, let us raise in our hearts oar altar to John Brown, the immortal benefactor of our race, tho boly vict-'m of our cause, and let us adopt as our sister and friend his worthy a ad unfortunate widow." Of all tho champions of the holy war against the abeurd prejudices of color, and the Infamous doctrine of the subjugation of one part of the human race to another, John Brown is the most illustrious and most unfortunate.

Now you say Saturn is round. Does Galileo think anybody believes him ? This was a moment of tri- umph to the enemies of tho philosopher and his ne w- fangled teashings; andaeore trial it wae to the braveBMOOKLYWITEMS.W e Y ouwith that of the planet's equator, cause a great secular .tide in the fluid ring, just as tbe moon does in the wa- ters of the ocean. It should be remembered that the density of the ring is somewhat greater than water. Now observe what follows from this theory, in case of our own planet indeed under the moon's action, as well as of the ring of Saturn under the like action of its sat- ellites. The friction of the particles of the fluid mass upon each other in the movement of these great tidea, Saturnian and terrestrial alike, tends to retard the mo- tion of the mass revolving in the opposite direction. Hence a gradual loes and final extinction of such mo- tion, although for centuries inappreciable. In case of the ribbon-like, fluid ring of Saturn, this effect will be very great, as it must revolve round its center of gravity, which is not quite the center of figure of the primary, in the same periodic time which a satellite would have if situated at the same distance from the planet. N o w this distance is euch as to give to the mass a period considerably less than a Siturnian day! While the ring, being fluid, the different concentric zones of it will flow upon each other, those ncares: the planet being carried around with greater velocity thanthose more remote. Fiom this it would appear that there will ensue from the action of the satellites a great tide in the ring at least daily, resulting in a rapid lose of motion. This leads us to expect that some impor- tant change in the constitution or position of the ringhas been formed, the object of which is te secure areduction in the hours of labor on the part of youngmen and boys employed in dry goods and other storesin, the city. In pursuance of its object* the Union haveissued an address to their employers, to the public, andto each other, in which are set forth the reduction ofhours claimed, reasons for claiming it, and the resultscalculated,to flow from such a reduction, not only to ceived in the following manner: On Sunday morning a tea- kettle of boiling water had been taken from the stove and placed themselves but to the community.
