He was not surprised that the disunion threats of a certain class of Southern- politi- cians excited only derision, but those who say least would be found the most potent and dangerous ad- versaries, and the indorsement of the Helper book, the John Brown invasion and the emissaries detect- ed in the South, and properly punished, had done mere to weaken the bonds of the Union in the las; twelve months, than all else within his memory. These events had aroused in his people a spirit hard to allay. Many of their merchants had ceased to visit Northern marts, and their business men and artisans were taking measures to secure commercial independ- ence, were assured that political independence mast easily follow. They were no longer to remain mere cotton-growers and producers for the _North. The hardy mountaineer would grasp his rifle still more firmly when he learned that the North is still aggressive, and that territorial restriction and emancipation are the order ofthe day. He knew they were not to be benefited byturning loose ahbrde of lazy free negroes, and that the honor of thoir wives and daughteis would not be safe an hour if all restraints were removed from the slave population.. Thus all classes were ready to meet the issue if it were forced upon them, and would rot shrink from it. They were lovers of the Constitution, and were willing to maintain it in its .integrity, but would never submit to have it explained away under the cry of Union. If aggreB*ions were continued under tha+i cry, they would meet it with the slogan " the South/' "the South."
