One of his favorite rscre- ations was listening to musiCj of which he was an in- dulgent critic, ana he contrived to be pleased and soothed by strains less artfully modulated than fastid- ious eare are apt to require.His facility in writing and the charm of his style were owing to very early practice, the reading of good authors and the native elegance of hi* mind; and not, in my 'opinion, owing to any epecial study of the graces of manner or a n y anxious care m the use of terms and phrases- Words and combinations of words are Eometimss found in his writings to which a fas-tidious taste might object; but these do not prevent his style from being one of the most agreeabli in the whole range of our literature.

In the evening he was ready for any cheerful pastime, i n which h e took part-with an animation almost amounting to high spirits. These intervals of excitement and intense labor, sometimes lasting for weeks, were succeeded by languor, and a t times by depression of spirits, and for months the pen would lie untouched; even to answer a lette* a t those times was an irksome task.In the evening'he wrote but very rarely, knowingÑ so, at least, I rulerÑthat no habit makes severer de- mands uptn t h e nervous system tnan this.
