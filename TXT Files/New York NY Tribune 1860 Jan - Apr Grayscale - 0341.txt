The carrot is the most es- teemed of all the roots for its feeding qualities. When analysed it gives but little more solid matter than the other roots, 85 per cent being water; but its influence in the stomach upon the other.articles of food is most favorable, conducing to this most perfect digestion and akimilation. This result, loog known to practical men, is explained by chemists as result- TME from the prtesence of a substance called fectine, which operates to coagulate or gelatime vegeta- ble solutions and favors this digestion. Horses are especially benefited by the use of carrots.

Two orthreespeciesare made by some botanists of the turnips, which exhibit such great variations in form and color, while others embrace them all in one. No class of plants exhibits greater adaptation to the various conditions to which it is enbjected by culture, and though they have been long known, it is but recently that they have acqui ed any importance as farm crops. Hence we may antici- pate a high degree of improvement in the future.

It is regarded as the test case, and affects all the banks in tne State, as ftr as the holding of United States stock is eon-. earned. Brfore its close, the case will probably be taken to the Supreme Comt of the United States for final adjudication. The case was argued for the bank by Mr. Irving Paris and ex-Surro- gate Bradford, and for the defendants by Mr. Itufos F . Andrews, with whom was associated the Assistant Corporation Counsel, H. H.
