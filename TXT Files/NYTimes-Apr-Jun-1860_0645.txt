AeCourtboUsthat In taking these maitgaces Ite Compaay did not attempt to do anything ex- cept to excenta its power of bailding a railroad,nie nortcager was willing to take the stock, bat kad DO DMDey. He was wilUng to gWn Us note and secure it by mortgage. The OeBipany took it in payment with the scde intention of transferring it to raise tlie money. The result Is the same as if the mortgage had been giren to a third party for the sams t^ttt. On the second branch of the ^piestion, aa to whether the charter reqnlres an absolnte snbactiption In cash, to tie paid in nothing bat cash, the oAirt holds that Ikaie is so sneh express provision in the Ckartar. The use of the word " dollars" is steply to indicate the measnre of value. The^Charter prescribes no manner or kind of payment."Ctnjt, boekosa of theirconfidence is tlie auccesr^the time, manner and propor- tfoDs" of tfie installments are left to the Directors. It la not the primary object of the Charter to raise an amount of money equal to the capital stock ; Qiat object is to build and equip a railroad, and the Cenrt can see no objection to issuing stock and taking in payment materials or labor or lands ne- ¥easary for their road. The authorities quoted on this pointarenumerous. Norwasthetakingofthese mortgages an unwarrantable dealing in real estate. Yhen ia nothing, say s the Court, in the transaction, approachhig a speculation in lands. Kor was it a baud on the cash-paying subscribers to the tack. They do not complain, and if the transac- tion ia liable to no other objection a party to it cannot set' up his own fraud to defeat Us contract- The potcer of the Company is therefore affirmed' and the lecuriltM in question declared valid. The judgment of the lower Court is reversed, and thecase remanded for further proceedings.In view of the foregoing decision of the Su- preme Court of Wisconsin, in favor of the validity of Farm Mortgages, the holders of such mortgages leaident haie, or who may chance to t>e in the City, are reqneated to call at Uie office of the Milwau- kee and Hisaisuppi Company, No. 29 William- treet, where the opinion of the Court at lengthand other information of interest may be had.The coupons of the Sacramento Valley Rail- TOad Company, due 1st July, 1S60, on $400,000 tfm Uortgage Boiids, will be paid after that dayat the office of ScHUOH^mDi i, Gkbhabdt.The receipts at the tide-water of Flour, Wheat, Cotn, end Barley, for the third week inJune in 1660 and 1869 have been.as foUows :Ob the contrary,Fkw.bUs. 1880 as 400 I8H 13.100hcresas.. a,380The sggiegates of thÇ receipts of the above artl-Çtes ilDce the canal opened, so far, for toe years laso aad 1869, have been :Plaor, bbla.
