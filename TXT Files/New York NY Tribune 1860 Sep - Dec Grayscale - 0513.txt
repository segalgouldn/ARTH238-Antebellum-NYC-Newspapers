A blue cockade was shown as a ^rnple of what all the Minute Men of New-Orleans are expected to wear, whenever called upon to turn out; it being.understood that whoever accepted such;a cockade stood pledged to take up his gun and march to the fight' whenever it should offer.The meeting then adjourned; and after the adjourn- ment, a great portion of the crowd enrolled their names as members, of tho Minute Men of New-Orleans.EFFIGY BURNING AT AIKEN.On the Oth there was a demonstration at Aiken, 3.formoneyamongthe holdersof shares andthoseJan. lcFor the n'erk.Entered'at the Tort.
