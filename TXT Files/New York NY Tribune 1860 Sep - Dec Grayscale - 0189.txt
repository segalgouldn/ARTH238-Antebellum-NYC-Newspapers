I (It is now m y duty to call your attention to certain reqnire- meifts, first, a s t o the law against usury. I t is a violation or that law to take more than 7 per cent per annum for"the use of money. Ifany Buch cooapKint should come before you it wi'l be your duty toAi diet the offenders. The i iolation ofthe lottery laws by sellirrg chances in.any game or lottery to be drawn within tbia 8tate, or. anytbirg required in order to tbe determination of any lottery, should such be sold wlihin this State, the party is liable to indictment. Another law which it is my duty to cnarge you on is ihit which prohibits the hale of liquor without a license, or any sale whatever on Surday*, or the adulteration of any liquor whatever, or the sale ol any such liquor when adulterated.•If any violation r.f the election lawg or'any unlawful interfer- ence with tbe elections should come before you, i t will be your duty to arrest the offenders. It ia also an offense to take any ille- gal fee or fees not autboiized by law by any public officer, and itotherstofprnishplans,ko.fortheconductionofpubl-curinals to be p'aced in different parts of tbe city. The aover^iaeuaents stated that the p'ans submitted would be placed before tbe Com- monCouncilfortheirchoice,andthatthosewhoseplanswere not accepted would have libertv to wi-hdraw tfce »ame. T h e Common Council have not acted in the matter ainc*, although Ihe plana were submitted to them. The plaintiff, after waiting some three y»ars, demanded « re'urn of his plans, which was re- fused, and brings tbis ac'inn for the conversion of the same. The defendants demurred to the complaint.Upon argument, Mr. H H - Anderson, for the defendants, maintained tbst the plans became the property of the city upon their delivery to the Common Council, and that tbe plaintiff had no claim tb them, and cited Bromlev va. Hoxwell 2, Boat. Pul. 438, and that no unreasonable time within which the decision of the Con mon Council should have been made, has elapsed. M r . G. B . Thompson, for the plaintiff, contended that the plaintiff never patted with his property in the plans—that tbe defendants were mere hsilees for the pUir tiff until their election was spade —that whe'her tbe time' elapa*d was r^asnnable or unreasonable / W8S a question c f fact for a jory. and could not be raised on de- murrer. The Court over id* d the d*murrer with costs, aad gavejudgment for plaintiff, with liberty to the defendants to answer on payment of costs.774- at.
