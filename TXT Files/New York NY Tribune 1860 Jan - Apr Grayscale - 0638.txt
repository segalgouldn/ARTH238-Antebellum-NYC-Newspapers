The prices of Domestic Cot- tons the past Beacon have been quite satisfactory, and, under a system o f greater diversity o f production, the stocks o f goods have been kept low, and immoderate quantities have not been pressed on the market. T h e impression exists that the production o f o u r looms i s not eqnal to the regular consumption a n d export d e - mand, and that no important change in prices will oc- cur for months to come. This, however, will depend upon the pacific character o f the world, and more par- ticularly upon the quietness o f Europe and the Conti-nent! Anydisturbancestherewouldaffectourmar- ket at once, this being t h e most convenient depot in which to re&Hze on surplus stocks which may be re- stricted in sale in other markets.
