By "dirt" the reader b to understand real estate, which Creeley used to call ''robbery."The philosopher of the TribeH* cannot see any good reason for the property qualification in the case of negroes, and contends there ought to be no distinction between them and white men. Thb argument proceeds upon the assumption of the black race being equal to the white which is contrary to notorious fact.the better, and that a fair trial should be given to the scheme embraced in the new bill. Not- withstanding it was shown that under the old law no such latitude of mischief exbted as wa-È furnished by thb measure, it was forced through the Legislature by a tyrannical majority, ut- terly regardless of the remoc>trances of the community whose interests were mo3t affectedby it.I or a time a certain show of impartiality waskept up by the maintenance on the commission of a few democrats, care being taken, however, that the republicans should always be in the majority. The constituting the Mayors of New York and Brooklyn ex-officio members was, how- ever, merely a temporary concession, which the framers ot tbe scheme were compelled to make to public opinion. So sweeping.and revolu- tionary a change would have at once betrayed its objects if the chief magistrates of the dis tricts most affected by the provisions of the bill were excluded from all share in its admia istration. They were, therefore, put upon the Board to give to it at the outset something of a municipal character, and to impart a coloring of fairness to its purely partisan organization.For a time thb farce was kept up, and inno- cent people began to believe that we were at last going to have a model police.

We give a full report of the proceedings elsewhere.j which New York, the material and intellectual ' centre of the confederacy, last night sent forth to all the sister States, in behalf of the frater- nity and -equality of all, will find a heartfelt echo in every one of them.

It is no narrow, sectional or partisan effnsion. It rises to the height of the occasion, with a masterly analysis of the true nature of the issue in the ('residential election, and a clear insight into the future, deducing by a most cogent logic the effect from the cau-e. and showing, with almost prophetic vision, the disastrous consequences which must reiult from the triumph ol the republican party. We refer to the speech.of Mayor Wood, which is worthy of the intelligence o the chief magis- trate of this great commercial metropolis.Is defeated: It matters not which section of th-* conservatives is triumphant, if the black repab- licacs are overthrown.The Breckinridge men are threatening to ruj a separate ticket if they cannot'get a fair pro- portion of electors on the fusion ticket: aad av> they are numerous in Ne^ Vsrk city aad Brook- lyn, tbe effect would be diaasuo'is. resulting with certainty in the victory of Lincoln.
