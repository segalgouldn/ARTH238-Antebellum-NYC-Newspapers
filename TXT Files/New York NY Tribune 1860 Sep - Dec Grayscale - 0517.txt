'The case being closed, Mr. Clinton asked the Court to charge theJurythatthelawwasunconstitutional,andthereforenocon- viction could be had. This request was based on the ground that the law was contrary to-the Constitution, which provided that no person should be deprived of his life or property without due process of law. He claimed that the law did not make any dis- tinction leases made before the act was passed and lease, made subsequently. Mr. Clinton made an elaborate argument on this point, and then summed up the case for the defendant, oSaimins- that in fact he haduot violated the act. The prosecution hadnot proved that the defendant was at the place at all on the 23th ofHay,andtherewasnoproofof-hishavinggivenanexhibition on that day.
