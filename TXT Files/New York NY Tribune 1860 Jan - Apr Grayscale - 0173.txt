Then it cost twice as much to eend you away to the keatben though tbe American Missionary Society asthrough the American Beard.Bro. TAPFAI* said that tbis error arose from counting•the expense of circulating 21,000 of their penoiicil -every month in the expenses of the Associatioh.Bro. B E E C H E R thought that a legitimate expense. He preferred the American Board, also, because it waj old, and was hahtewed by assoc|at«on.- It was objected to tbe AmericanBoard that it was a close corporation. He compared its action with that of the American Tract Soeietv., an open corporation, much to the disa<!- vanfc»jre of the latter. On the ^nearton of Sl»yery; he proceeded to defend the Board. The«e Indian Missions went away back to the time when there was no agita- tion atainst Sbtverv. Aud the churches then estaiv Kabed were independent; their independence, ltkethat of all other churches under the American Board, being carefollv guarded. H e did not believe th*tslavehold-SJ« was" necessarily «">fuj. There was no such t-nug as a thing being bad per &*, or good j^$e.. That wa< a scholastic subtlety. Nothing was bad per se_and nothing was ^ood «?r #c A thing that was bad m itsre*ulaf was bad, 2nd a thing good in its results was good. The questioawith .regart to Slavery was, whether it wZs Jbancful in its ^ f ^ f j American Board had taken this ground: Tnat selfi.h*Javeholdi»g was reprobencible; bat it a man put in circumstances -where h e eoohlnot help '&,andso would Christ.

But it was, not reasonable to ask that the Ctmrcbes auwng the Choctawa should become Anti-Slatrery-bofore I>r. Spring's or the Mercer-street Church became so, or half t£e£bDTcbes in Brooklvn. Mr. Beecher reviewed the course of tbe American 'SJoardin regard to Slavery amongthe Cnoctaw|Churches. He thought the book* of Comrthiao* the best adaptation of Christian pnnci-•pie to tbe actual state of things, and next to tbetn he placed MrfTreat's report on the American Board and Slavery ia the Cherokee and Choctaw Churches.
