He spoke of three universal em- pires of the world.' The first, he said, was projected by Philip, the second by Caesar, and the third the universal empire of Christ. The two former had their evils, but in the main they advanced the social con- dition of man, and left it to be perfected by the empire of Christ, which, was destined to emancipate .the world. Christians should not rest in the mere an- ticipation of tbat result, but should put forth their energies and zeal to accomplish what the universal kingdom of Christ demanded. Why did not Christians go out from then- fine,churches more than thev did, and sow and reap the harvests of their, religion f W h y not improve moral culture, have more school-books, and earnest speech ? The cry of the people now is for light; to give them books; and to give them more reason for believing as Christians did that-Christ would conquer and redeem the world. He believed that the time would come when all men would be just; that this world would be an empire of just and righteous men.':—» 'NEW^YORK CITY LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.This Society, which was formed a little oyer a year ago, and which received a charter at the bauds of the last Legislature, held its first annual meeting last evening, at No. 3 Abingdon square.
