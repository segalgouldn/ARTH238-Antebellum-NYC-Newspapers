B. Wilson's invention of the feed morion, and consequently the patents founded upon it.Some objections have been taken in the defense, independently of,the question upon the invention, which It ia necessary briefly tonotice:"'- ; • ;'.1. A n objection that the proper parties complainants have not been joined in the suit.This objection is founded upon the testimony of Orlando B . Potter, who was examined as awituess for the complainants.. He states that the suits were commenced for the. interest and benefit of the two companies represented by himself and Na- thanielWheeler^namely,theWheelerandWilsonManufactur- ing Company, and the Grover it Baker Sewing Machine Compa- ny; and that they have no Interest in the suits, except as repre- sentativesofthetwocompanies, andasstockholders therein. Thatthepatentsareheld bythem us trustees ofthese compa- nies.Theproofsshow thatthelegal titletothe.patents,and exclu- sive right to them in the State of New-Yoxk, are in the complain- ants; and in a court of law they are the only parties proper to bring tho suits.It is urged, however, that in equity all partie3 must be joined who are interested in the subject-matter of the litigation.. In one sens©, according tc the testimony of Potter, these tw o companiesmaybesaidtobeinterested,butwhether soornot, as to require them to be joined In tbe suit, is notcertain. If they are but licensees under Potter and Wheeler, then their in- terest would not be such as would, in the sense of the law of pa- tents,requirethemtobejoined: andthis is the relation'they holdtothecomplainant*,asintdsteduponbytheircounsel.Thisobjectionastopartieswasnottaken intheanswer,nor do tbe proofs on either side seem to have been directed to the, .question.

The statute provides that in cases where the stockhold- ers refuse or neglect to pay up their proportion, the Company may, under the direction of the Controller, forfeit their propor- tionate share of stock, and issue new certificates forthe amount of tb« deficient capital, which in this case was finally fixed at$33,000, but the officers of the Wall-street Fire Insurance Com- pany gave their stockholders the option to pay twenty-five per cent in cash on their stock, or forfeit fifty percent; and in this manner, aud by the threat of taking proceedings to dissolve tho Company and close up its affairs, the Directors irregularly com- pelled the forfeiture of a lirge amount of stock, thus reduci&g, according to the testimony ot the Secretary, the outstanding now stock to $147,620, and leaving only $780 of the old stock unsur- rendered.I find from the testimony that the present capital and assets of the Company consist of the following items: .•.-"•'BOUDS AND MORTGAGE* on lots at " Nassau Height*," near New- town, Queens County, mostly 25xV.O feet each:No. I.

Thesurface isundulating, and in someplaces consid- erably elevated; in others low and marshy. The Wilson Mort- gage covers a small pond of water designated on tho lithographic map as " Sylvan Lake." T h e Commissioners appointed o y t h e 8wpr«me Court (Charles G. Covert, Dar>i>l R. Suydam, aad Stephen Haynes) to settle theamount of damages tothe owners of lands taken'by the railroad, viewed aud examined the prem- ises, heard testimony and counsel in several cases, and after suchC and D, containing certified copies of tho orders confirming tho reports of the Commissioners In the cases of Harris Wilson and Benry Flewry). About eight hundred of these lots arevaluod in the Assessment Roll of too town of Newtown, on an average at $ 6 82perlotThe values of the different lots of course vary, according to loca- tion and situation, but I have deemed it sufficient for the purpose of my examination to moke an average valuation, andiu my opinion the average,value of toe lots mortgaged to the Company willnotexceed$35each.• ThebondsofWnxDanforth,EmmaM.SItzer,andJohnRed- mond are probably uncollectable. .Ontoeorganizationofth*Company,itscapitalseemstohave been mode up in part of $75,000 of mortgages executed by S.

The Company now claim to enforce the wholeamountdueontheCaldwell mortgageagainstthatpartof the farm, notcovered by the mortgages owned by the Company. This claim would probably be rejected by the Court on fore- closure, and an equitable apportionment made of the amount due on the "Caldwell mortgage, over the whole form.Mr. Stiles, the Secretary, testified that William A Darling and Cibbm s L Keltyhad purchased the property at "Nassau Heights" and In Cattaraugus County, covered by the mortgages owned by the Company, and that they had made a payment of oneyesr's interest on the mortgages on the 20th day of Decem- ber, 18£9, amounting to the sum of $8,029 34.No.XV.Bondandmortgage,ofFrederickV.Taft for$17,500.
