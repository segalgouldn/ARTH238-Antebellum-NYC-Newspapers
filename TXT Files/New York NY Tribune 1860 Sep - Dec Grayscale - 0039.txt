A. procession of some kind, then, there mast be, anda procession there- was, at 3 o'clock yesterday af wr- noon, some hcurs before the arrival of the Prince in which all the Orange resorirceB were demonstrated to tbeir fullest extent. For a while, the streets were flooded with the brightest Orange hues, and a great line of men, attired according to tbe dictates, of the order, and beaded by the Hon. J. H. Cameron, a man of infloence and position, who nevertheless holds the office of G-and Master among them (undoubt*dly sUoh positions have their uses in' stirring political timet) wound through* tbe city without impediment, ending by a pantomime, of some deep bat undiscovered pur- port, before a Roman Catholic Church. Having' thus courageously insulted their feeble enemies, and other-wise vindicated their party dignity, they gradually dis- persed, although quite a number lingered in bodies, with banners and insignia, until after tbe hour fixed for tbe Prince's reception, which was declared to be a etubborn violation of their pledge. Certainly, the ap- pearance of the Orangemen' in this city was infinitely more respectable than tbat of th*ir brethren iu King- ston. There were fewer men of the aepect of the vagrant painter Robinson, or Flannigan the butcher and there were many of sufficient air of decency to-ex- cite a wonder how tbey could consent to countenance, by their participation, a p9rade which after all wasonly a lees distinctly oflensive one than the disorderly and despicable show at Kingston, and which partook of much of its irregular character.The Prince left Cobonrg early Friday morning; and proceeded bv railroad to Peterborough, stopping briefly on the way at the village of Otonabee, where he enjoyed refreshing commune with an ancient Indian chief, aod he-»rd the national anthem performed by a band"of abo- riginals. At Peterborough addresses were exchanged, aftar which the party proceeded to Port Hope-. Hers a vestige of latent bad humor was revealed.
