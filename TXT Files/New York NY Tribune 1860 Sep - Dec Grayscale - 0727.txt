The pro- pi icn>rs of Music liall demanded and obtained a bond for $00,COO, to secure them against any po-*ftib!e loee by destruction of furniture, before they consented to opeu tbe bulbar g. The Hall was overwhelmingly crowded,and hundreds vainly sought admission.Mr. Phillips's address was a bitter onslaught upon allthe disturbers of the Tremont Temple Convention, aiid their outside abettors, and be had not proceeded far, before angry hisses from the galleries showed that a considerable element of opposition wne prce<eut. .The fina demonstration'was caiu-cd by bis declaring, of the juvenile respectable rioters, that they went, to tt>e Temple to prove themselves rotten before they were rij e. A chirping, youthful chorus of deliance followed this, with afcwcritsof "All up," and other party watch- words. There were subsequently several maturer explosions of impotent wrath, to which Mr. Phillips gave no heed, repeating each' phrase that was inter- rupted, with fresh emphasis, until quietly listened to.The number of disturbers was so comparatively small th>it timidity conquered bad temper, and all the attempted tumults fell stillborn. Hides'and jcoriug laughs, and applause when none was expected, were, h< wever, frequently repeated. All noisy demonstra- tions proceeded from the opponents Of Mr. Phillips. Tl e congregation generally kept perfect silence, in com- pliance with bis special request at tbe outset.The assemblage waa well, sprinkled with pobcemen, preparedtolcsistanyviolentinterruption,andalarge 'reserve/force was keptsoutof sight for further precau- tion. A part of the military was held in readiness. After the services h.d ended, tbe crowd poured rapidly cut, and loitered in the jiassage leading to Winter street, and uj.on the sidewalks. Mr. Phillips came among tbe hist. As soon as he was discovered in the doorway, a rush was made toward him, and for a few minutes there was a scene of as wild confusion as thatof tie Tremon.t Temple riot.T i e narrowness of the passage prevented any suc-cepsful attempt to seize Mr. Phillips, who, surroundedthree reasons, is not correct: First, because there hasto inspect here, as if that helped.
