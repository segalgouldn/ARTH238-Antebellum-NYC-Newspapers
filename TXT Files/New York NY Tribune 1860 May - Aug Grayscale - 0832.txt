During the past threeor fcur months, he lived entirely on •fruits.weeks he ate cherries and nothing else, and in this fortnight accomplished the greatest days work of his fife. Hisexperiencetaughthim that fruitdiet isthe very best for man. As he conformed to it, he felt bet- ter in mind and body. Especially were his teeth and voice in good condition while fruit was his only food. The bread and butter he was compelled to take on thelate voyage were a real injury. So sensitive have his organs become, that he can tell when he has been eating other than his favorite food by the color of his teeth. While living on cherries, his teeth were never set on edge by their acidity, while sugar introduced into the mouth, in however small quantity, immediate-ly had this effect.Mr. Martin was a constant and living hearer of the late Theodore Parker, and was a member of the active .society called the " Fraternity," his affection for which he sought to indicate by giving his wherry the name.He has always had a passion for rough-and ready e x - cursions, and a year since went to Montreal, and camped out, but, before last year, had never rowed a boat, nor has h e ever participated in any regatta or race. The only training h e has had was that gained by his pleasure excursions out of Boston, seldom e x - ceeding a distance of ten miles. To test his capacity for the long voyage, he rowed recently to Plymouth, a matter of 50 miles.*m*' ...On the 8th of August, at 2 o'clock, the'bold oarsmanlaunched his craft and rowed that evening to Plymouth, in eight hours. T h e greatest difficulty experienced throughcut the cruise was in regard to distances, uponthere is no power in the General Government to legis- late upon the subject of Slavery in the States of the Union, -whether.to establish, or abolish, or regulate^or interfere with, it i n any manner whatsoever. Upon this whole' subject the States, confessedly and beyond controversy, aresovereign. Butthequestion that dietnrbs the harmony, and threatens the existence of tbe Union, is the lees important one of Slavery inthose Territorial possessions which a r e not yet sufficiently populous to be admitted as State* into the Union, and over which Congress is vested with general legislative powers. What phall be the condition of those Terri- tories, and who shall determine it ? That is the ques- tion upon which the whole controversy hingus. A n d hieDce have arisen the sectional hatreds, the violence of mobs,'the disruption o f religious eocieties and of parties, and the schemes of disunion that threaten the existence of our fabric of Free Government. The open- ing o f that question was, a s has happily been said, the opening of Pandora's box; to close it, is to close the onlv serious controversy that disturbs the peace of the Union.Upon this question, so fruitful o f evil, we have no less tban four putties, a l l o f which propose different remedies and modes.of settlement.We have a Northern Sectional party, that demands that Congress sba'l prohibit Slavery in all the Territo- ries of the United States. ' \ '-'•*._A Sou*he?n Sectional party, that demands that Con- o^rees shall uphold Slavery in all the Territories Of the United States.A party that demands that Congress shall not inter- fere with Slaverj in tie Territories at all, but that the people of the Territories shall determine the question themselves. •••."'•"'•'And lastly, we have a party established for the verypurpose of crushing agitation a n d restoring harmony,and which, in the moae by which it seeks to accomplishthis object, differs materially from all the other parties.This Union party has laid down no platform, and estab-' 'For twobetween Northern and Southern men" upon this ques-Thirdavenue,afwwday*aluce.Shewaaknockeddownandae- andtheeightofalllandwaslost.

Most often he w a s asked why he rowed from Boston to New-York. There were three principal reasons.the trust confided to them, herewith report the result of iheir labors, together with the reasons on which the same is founded.In doing this it will he convenient briefly to refer to the present divisions of parties and to the principles upon which such divisions are founded.The issufstbat formerly divided parties seem to have become entirely obsolete.

Any citizen of a slaveholding State, who upholds the constitutional fea- ture of its institutions, is, b y t h e Republican platform, ineligible t o any office ; certainlyjjto any one that de- pends on pupular suffrage, and according to the practice of parties, from any office whatever. Thus it appears that the Republican party is, substantially, an organi- zation to exclude the citizens of the Southern States from all share in the government of our common coun- try. This principle, and it is a fundamental principle, of the Republican party, a party that we are told is in- tended to be a permanent one, or at least to last as long as Slavery lasts, is a palpable violation of the spirit of the Constitution, and if persisted in, must, in the event of the permanent successof that party, inevitably cause a dissolution of the Union.It wasnever contemplated by theframersofthe Constitution that the people of nearly half th'e States should be denied all voice in the government, and that a majority of the States should coiispire together to usemonths.FORT—At Kingston, New-York, on Friday, August 24, t h e Rev.
