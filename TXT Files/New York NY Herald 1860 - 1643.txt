 NEW YORK HERALD.Oenvem-^p-^ir.BMSlBkK lA WBfÑfB\B VrUmme SSUr*È SB\*lBBWBÈThe central organ of the black republican patty Ufasa terrible state of salad over an ar- ticle which lately appeared in one of the weeklies in relation to the Sunday law whichwas enacted by the last Legislature. Thearti- cle which has so exercised the Tribwx phUoeo- phers takes tbe ground that the Sunday law is the invention of the republican party, and that the leaders of that party are pandering u> Pres- byterian cant and bigotry.at the expense of the working man. who finds in the Sabbath hU only holiday.Ll opposition to this very well founded ac- cusation, the TVibune sets up a general denial. Tbe observance of the Sabbath, says our philoso- pher, "has probably nothing to do WHO our current politics." "Probably" It would not if there were no republican party to make it an issue. The TKbune complains bitterly of the efforts which axe made to "draw all the loose snd reckless pleasure seekers of our city into an attitude of hostility to the republican party:" but neither the tears nor the protesta-tions of the republican organ wfll avail against solid facte.Lot as examine the matter. The constitu- tion of the United States, as It stands, placet men of all creeds upon the same political foot- ing. Our sires had suffered too much from the political power which was in the old time placed in the hands of the priesthood to con- tinue it under the new regime. The absence of anything like religious restriction in the fede- ral constitution swept away, with one blow, all the tyrannical enactments of the Puritans, but did not extinguish the spirit of bigotry which ex- isted in the hearts of certain pious people,whose faith consists in tbe belief that Heaven is a small private park, to which they have exclu- sive keys, and that everybody who tries to get in by some means other than theirs will be ine- vitably and incontinently damned. This section of the community Includes many parsons ofÑÑHow York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana of political infor- will be given to the farmers, mechanics and merchants of the Central and Western States, between this time and November, would be sufficient to set half adozen parties in business.Tan Wonts CH am CENTRAL PAWL,Ñ11 Is Of the utmost importance that every facility shall be afforded to the Central Park Commissioners for actively poshing em tiae works in the Park during the fine season. No obstacles of a pe- cuniary nature should be allowed to stand la tbe way of the rapid execution of the plans, it is to be regretted that so much valuable time should have been lost la the spring, first by the hesitation oi the Legislature, and them by mo slower action of the cIty Boards. If the Cummiasioners had boon placed in possession of the funds which toey required earlier in the reason, the works would have exhibited a siderable advance upon their preaoni gratifying as that is.On the 25th of April an ordinance passed by the Board Of Aldermen authorising an emission of Central Park stock to the amount of $250,000.

As matters turned at Chariestoo.it is now evident that had the seceding delegations stood op to their+*y in the Convention, and defended the interests of their constituents through the whole fight, instead of running away, a compromise and oonservativo ticket would have been adopted, under which the rights and the interests of the South would have been safe, and in support of which the national sentiment would have everywhere rallied. Even when the se- ceders abandoned their posts, the disor- ganiasrs had to adjourn the Convention to save themselves from defeat by the national men who remained true to their duty in that body. The Southern constituencies, in com- missioning those delegations to the adjourned Convention at Baltimore, have given a practi- cal aad strong rebuke to the men who desire to get up a Southern sectional party as an offniu>'i <iiion,iM4ÇÇr - I U I R U C i m n .wurfaa OABDBPBÈw T oaa-tnvi** 1* OH.WaJU.AO*VS THBATBB,¥ii-ii¥¥UUI* TaSATBS. gsti n ÇI P U OF MA<iIO, 441n l WiMOOI-fATIOflALr ALACB OABDU.i n s a t ataaiSALOON.*e*o*aiWere the CommissionThe Rkkmoad Convention has very sensibly committed infanticide oa the Southern sec**- ev uuua **È wcutm am sion movement, by raaolfing togo into a re- cess until after the Baltimore Convention snailEWTOB AND psurunos.prevent a repetition of scenes similar to that of Pyramid Lake.The news from Oregon, California and Washing- ton Territory ia unimportant.and thefends i tvery forcibly impressed with the fact that when the Tribune tries to worry the republicanl o t progressing favorably.There are rumors of war between Nicaragua andSalvador, bat they are not considered reliable..

The sum that was appropriated was too small to enable them to push forward the works with the spirit and energy which could be infused into them with the requisite command of funds. They therefore sent In a communication to the Board of Aldermen on Monday, asking for an ordinance authorizing an Issue of stock to toe amount of $833,000, being the entire sum that will be required for the operations of the current year.We trust that this matter wfll not be allowed to hang fire In the two Boards. The money has got to be paid at some time or otherto the Commissioners, and every motive of policy and economy dictates that it shall be given to them as promptly as toe necessary forms will permit By furnishing them at once with the funds necessary for the current expenses of the year, they will be able to avail themselves of the fine weather and push for- ward the works with all possible rapidity. It will be unpardonable if, through indifference or toe absence of the corrupt stimulus usuallyclose at hand when an injured and endangered country demands that they shall lay aside their insane bickerings, and unite on some man in whose support they can all rally for the common good. There are dozens of such men prominent in the political history of the country, commanding the confidence ofwealth and influence.times, to cause to be-passed unconstitutional and tyrannical acts, such as the Sunday laws which exist in many of the Northern States, and the absurd enactment prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors, known as the Maine law.
