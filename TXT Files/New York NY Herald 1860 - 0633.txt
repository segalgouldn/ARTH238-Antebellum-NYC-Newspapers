Manysecond orders have been received from the South, and tbacity jobbers have been renewing their purchases to main- SteamuMp Yorktown. Pamah. Norfolk. Ac. wtth arise and tain dun assortment*. Tan supply of goods is, however,ton immense to maintain any great firmness or stealiness in prices. The auctions of French silks have commenced, and the over importaton is oeing felt. Woollens also are in the same predicament, and press heavily on the market. Brits a goods have been less freely imported, but Conti- nental goods quits the reverse. In domestic goods there has been a heavy export demand for the East, mostly for China. All stap'e cotton fabrics are in good demand and dim in price. Prints are, however, dull and heavy at a cocsiderebto decline in price. Fancy cissimeres are less active. The over import of toreign woollens interferes greatly with the domestic roods market. Prices favor the consumer in every branch of dry goods. The Western common ay are very backward in their purchases. The auction sales tins week have drawn to the city the leading retailers and jobbers of all the principal cities in the country. The sale of silks on Monday was a sad one for the importers—resulting in a less of from tea to thirty percent. The sty )<es were bad. Tuesday's sale showed more firmness, and a better class of goods. On Wednes- day all grades of goods sold much better, particularly those descriptions of silks which cost from four to five francs. Trade now is fairly open, and, with an easy money market, we look for a rushing business at low prions for the nest two months. Country buyers should hurry off old stocks fiom their shelves, and hurry hence for most advantageous investments.The imports of foreign goods at Boston for a aeries of years past were as follows:—Basaenxera. to Ludlam A Heineken.
