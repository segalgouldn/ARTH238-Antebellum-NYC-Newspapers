A warrant was ac- cordingly issued, and placed in the hands of Officer Snow, w h o arrested t h e accused o n Thur»d»y evening, a n d brought him before the magistrate yesterday morning for exam- ination. It appears from the statement of the lady in question that she came from England in the same ship with Hilton. O n their ariival here, they both took up their residence in Jersey City. A t first, Hiljton attended regularly to his business, but soon became somewhat embar- rassed in money matters, and knowing tbat his friend, Miss Fox, hadasnuglittleBum,herepresented hiscasetoher,andshead- vanced bim $200, and received a mortgage upon some property he had in England. T o all outward appearance, everything passed off pleasantly between t h e parties until a [few days ago, when Hilton called upon his lady friend and wanted her to exe- cute a transfer ofthe mortgage, which she refused ito do, stating a't the time that she intended to hold o n to it. Previous to this, anduptothetimethedemandwasmade;theybadagreedtoget married atsome future day; but the sudden request of Hilton had the effect o f changing t h e l«dy's mind, .and s h e remarked, "To marry yon isentirely out of the question.1^; High words arose; Hilton first applied abusive language toward the woman, and then, it is alleged, attempted to tako her life.
