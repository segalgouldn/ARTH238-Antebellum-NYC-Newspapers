With his surrender the revolution in the States of the Church would complete, nothing then remaining to be ac- complished but the settlement of the conditions on which the Pope is to be allowed to retain possession of Rome. Although this has been guaranteed both by France and Sardinia, it is not to be supposed that the righto of its inhabi- tants will be overlooked in the arrangement No settlement can be regarded eer permanent which continues the same despotic system of government over one portion of the Pope's sub- jects that has been successfully repudiated by therest Whilst,therefore,thenominalsove- reignty of the Pontiff will be maintained, the changes suggested in the French Emperor's confederation project will undoubtedly be carried out The inhabitants ofRome, al- though still compelled to acknowledge the head of the Church as their titular ruler, will have their liberties placed under such muni- cipal guarantees that it will be out of the power of the priesthood to again enslave them. This, under the peculiar circumstances in which they are placed, is the only possible solution that can be given to a question which has caused more difficulty and embarrassment than any of the other issues that have arisen in connection with the political regeneration ofItaly.It is stated that efforts were being made by the Sacred College to induce the Pope to aban- don bis capital and seek refuge in Spain or Austria. We know no more suicidal step that he could take. Should he quit Rome at pre- sent we can promise him that he will never re- enter I t Were he to do so he would find him- self at once reduced to the status of the Greek and Armenian patriarchs, and deprived of all political consideration whatsoever. Far better would it be for him to accept the po- sition which the French Emperor has projected for him. He would then still occupy the rank of a European prince, with the capital of the world as his residence, and an adequate revenue guaranteed to him by the Catholic Powers. If Pius be not utterly bereft of worldly sagacity he will not reject these ad- vantages to trust himself to the precarious bounty of sovereigns who may be themselves exiles from their dominions before the revolu- tionary changes which are at present sweeping over the Continent are brought to a stand.These events in the Pontifical States hare re- lieved Garibaldi from ids pledges to the Roman people, and enabled him to concentrate his en- ergies on the preparations for his threatened descent upon Venice. If the statements that reach us be not exaggerated, he will very soon be at the head of an army of 150,000 men, with a fleet of some five hundred vessels. Now, al- though Austria has assembled an immense mili-tary force in Venice, measured against such re- sources as these, and located in the midst of a hostile population, it is easy to see that the odds are not so largely in her favor. Whatever advantage she may have in numbers will be more than compensated for by the enthusiasm of the liberating force and the magical influence of Garibaldi's name. Although the resolutions ef the German Diet and the re- cent understanding with Prussia protect her against intervention* by France, there is no such pledge of aid against a danger caused by her own continued harshness towards the Ve- netians. It is exceedingly doubtful whether, with the large invading force which Garibaldi will now have under his command, she will be able to hold Venice against him. The tearsthat she must entertain upon this point, as'wellas her misgivings in regard to Hungary, may over crime on shipboard, desertion of seamen, the position which the Southern States wouldinduce her to lend a favorable ear to the sug- gestion made to her by the other European go- vernments, that she should sell Venice to Sar- dinia, and thus get rid of a fruitful source of danger, whilst at the same time she would re- cruit her exhausted finances.

In such a contest it be- comes the duty of the people of Pennsylvania to throw overboard all the politicians, despise their influence, renounce their admonitions, and voteforMr.Fosterasamatterofsafetyforthe country.

Neeis it possible to misunderstand the point to which the South must inevitably be driven should the'v republican party attain power to carry out thepolicy which its leaders openly pronounce to be its especial mission and purpose.
