Taking all the circumstances of the esse into consideration, he thought that Mr. Bruee bad acted in a peremptory and precipitatemanner,andnotinthespiritofaMinisterwho went out lo ratify a treaty of peace. (Hear, hear.)Lord J. Bissau.— Ar, 1 suppose no one in this Hrase questions the professional opinions of the gallant Admiral, nor will anyonequestion hk seal In the service of the Crown and country. The gallant Admiral has received the approbation of the Admiralty, his Immediate superiors, and therefore I thick it quite unnecessary, Indeed impos- sible, to go into all the queat.ons to which he has adverted >s to bss conduct and his differences with the noble lordwho was her Majesty's Ambassador there. I doubt, too, whether this s an opportunity when w e can conveniently discuss the whole matter; but, at the same time, the hono- iah!e gentleman who brought forward the question made so many charges, and went into so much detail, that I can- no! altogether avoid questioning some parts of the narra- tive which he has given us. The House will recollect that Mr hru.ewassecttoChinaforthepurpose ofobtaining the ratification of the treaty of Tien tain. Before he went, be la,a a paper before Lord Malmesbury asking isstruc- tx-no, and saying that parts of the treity of Tien tain were IJteiy to be uupaiaubie to the Chinese and thai there m^ti be some difficulty which had not been foreseen in carrying them into effect H e did not mention that the entrance to the Petho was h k e l y t o b e r e s i s t e d ; b u t b e d i d a s k w a s h e t o t n s i a t u p o n goiLkr <>p to Pekin.

Letus suppose Mr. Bruce h a i takaa a ditterent course to thatwhicn he pursued, and let us consider what would havebeen the consequences, and what sort of judgment wouldhave been passed upon him in this country.
