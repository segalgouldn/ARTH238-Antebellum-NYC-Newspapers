When th e census of 1790 w a s lands, and thus create a demand for labor.'-taken, Delaware had 8,887 slaves; in the year18C0 she h a d 2,290; of these Sussex County h a dwithin her borders. 1,549; in.the year 1840 sheowned 1,737; thus showing a decrease o f about 1 0per cent from 1840 u p t o the subsequent census i nwhilewe note a decrease of 10 percentinthe former, w e see a decrease of 12 per cent in the latter. There' has been but one decade o f years in which there has been shown a n increased per cent; this was that period between 1810 a n d 1820; in this th e increase w a s b u t slight. Every other census has evidenced a material decrease, varying from 12to32 per cent; and although we arein possession of no precise data from which to judgeeffort was made to repeal this law, Ihe 'friends of the movement thinking it preferable to have no statute atall ofthis kind than one which was daily violated. H a d the repeal o f this law been passed, it is not difficult t o foresee what t h e effect would have been. In tw o years time but a moiety of tbe slave population would have been left. As it-is, the drain is exhaustive, a n d t h e institution becoming more and more circumscribed every day, and t h e indications are that the period is not very t a r distant when the county will be, in nearly every essential, free from Slavery, and the system b e classed with matters of history.NEW-JERSEY ITEMS.'*» .FOR STATK PRISON.—Thirteen convicts, tried duringth*latet*rzuoftbeHudsonCountyCourt,w«r«yesterdaytakonto State Prison at Trenton, by Sbenfi Fiancla aad apoaso of ©floors.
