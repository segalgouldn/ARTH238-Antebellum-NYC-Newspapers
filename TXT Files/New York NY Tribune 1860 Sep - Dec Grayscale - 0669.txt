On opening the door of this room, she saw Mis. Sbaucks's lifeless body stretched upon the floor, her features scarcely recog- nizable from the mutilation they •had suffered. The affrighted woman run to the street and alarmed the neighbors, and toon the bout* was filled by men and worotn. Among the first to arrive was Dr; Jones, •who. upon an examination of the body% found thatit was still warm, life having been extinct but a short time.The sknll of the murdered woman was extensively fractured, while her throat was cut from ear to ear, in socb a manner as to nearly sever the head from the body. An extensive gash waa also found, extending. from immediately beneath the left ear, across the cheek to the month, and thence downward to the point of the chin. A powerlul blow from a dull weapon had fallen upon the face of the deceased, breaking the bridge of the nc*e, and forming an open cut, extending into the socket of the left eye. T i e carpet on the floor was.saturated with her blood, and, in the large pool which had collected upon a small uncarpeted space on the floor, were the .shattered fragments of a heavy stone •water pitcher, and several heavy bottles.•The clothes and the entire upper portion of the body were covered with blood, and the face was so ensan- guined that it almovt resembled the features of a, colored person. Scattered about the room were various gar- aoents, upon which the murderer had wiped his bloody-jbands. A cupboard or drrt<ser, in one corner of the contracted apartment, also bore the imprint of bloody fingers; as did a large chest, and the door of the outer- room. A small paste-board box, in which the deceased usually kept her money, had been seized by bloody bands, and all that remained of its contents was a single penny. In the shop the fiue white articles of linen and lace had been overhauled by the same hands, and bore the same red marks.It waa apparent to all that plunder was the sole mo- tive which bad prompted the commission of the terrible feed,' and consequently suspicion could attach to noMeliish, Shorthand Reporter, delivers a lecture on bad notdone;«heaaidhewuatbeuthoretodothejibliehad PhonographicShorthandthisevening,at 7£o'clock,in•-'•-of .

Shancks, she has accu- ANNIVERSARY mulated, by her own industry, three or four thousanddollars. This, and her pleasing manners, had, at vari- ous times, drawn about her a few }oung flatterers, the characters of some of whom would not bear close in- spection. About one year ago two or three of these men managed to swindle her out of $1,700, which, sum was loaned to them v*bile one of them wan under an' engagement of marriage to her.Subsequently she has been engaged to two or threedifferent ones, among the latest of whom were Charks Hardy and William Chambers. It will be teen by the evidence before the Coroner, which we print below, that one of these men was little better than these who bad preceded him. The lady bears an unblemished reputation, but seems to have lent a too. willing ear to obsequious flatterers. The only, po'nt on which to hang a suspicion is ttie fact mention- ed in the evidence that a young carpenter, from 18 to 20 years of age, whose name is at present unknown, had caused her some annoyance. He had been em- ployed to do some work for her on one occasion, and subsequently received money foi another job which he had not done. The deceased had remarked to one ortwo of her acquaintances that she was afraid of thisyoung man, but could hot get rid of him. He -was in the habit of coming into her place andbarging around without any special object.On Friday morning, the deceased arose as usual, Lniit the fires in her room and shop, and commenced her work for the day. At 8 o'clock, a little girl named Elizabeth McMann, who bad, on account of Mrs. Shaneks's illness, been in the habit of bringing her meals to her, came to get her order for breakfast. Thisthe lady gave, remarking that she felt better than usualthat morning, and the girl departed. At twenty min-utes past 8 o'clock, the iittie girl returned with thebreakfast, when Mrs. Shancks told her to be sure andOF THE ST.come with her lunch at 1 o'clock.
