Coxaens, author of the " Sparrowgrass Papers." "IhavebeengreatlyinterestedbythisstoryoftheMobile heroine, and 1 am convinced that the story will produce a sym-patheticimpressiononthepublicmind. Thereisnotawordin ft, nor aphrase in it, that I have not meted and measured. Over and above the method of tellingthe story, the story itself wins, oommands, controls, the sympathies of the reader. This, I take it, is the highest test of excellence."DERBY fc JACKSON, Publishers,No. 1X9Nassan-st., New-York.TONIC AND PLATONIC.FUNGUS A T WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS.Lies down on the floor and takes a FRONT VIEW.GetsafairsightoftheGABLE END OF.
