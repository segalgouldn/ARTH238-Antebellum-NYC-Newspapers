Theanswer was that the Roman Catholic Church had no ob- jectiontoanyformofGovernment,aslonganit respectedtheright*andpropertyofthepriests,and that an alhanceWith Sardinia might be excused bypolitical necessity. .Still, if the King should ever ' a*cknowled*ge or guarantee the alleged •'rights • of VictorEmanueltotheLegations,theexcommuni- cation would fall upou his headtoo. However, if the arrangement between Naples and Sardinia seems not yet feasible, still Napoleon works hard both at Naples and Turin to bring about some understand- ing,returningtotheoldplanoftheFederalUnion of Italy under the honorary Chairmanship of; thePope.The Sardinian Cabinet still remains, therefore, ina very difficult position, out of wliieh nothing but a revolution at Naples' can extricate it. The unity and independence of Italy are at stake. A sharp, de- cisive revolution might .achieve it at once. Patriot- ism and enlightened policy advise such a revolution. All Italy requires it, and it is to be hoped that she will find means for accomplishing it. And, luckily, the conditions of the south of the peninsula are such as to make a revolution not altogether impossible. The publication of the Constitution excited- no en- thusiasm, and as it is simply the resuscitation of the•Constitution of l&fej the papers print it maliciously with King Ferdinand's famous preamble, in which,. onthe8thofFebruary,becalledGodtowitnesshis sincerity, and proclaimed his unalterable will to maintain that C<»n«titution. which three months later he repealed, banishing and imprisoning all those who iuui put their faith in the snnetity of hi*royal word.This precedent is ominous, fur then, as now, itwas the triumphant insurrection of" Sicily which breught about that deplorable Constitution which ruined all the Ministers and Deputies who had sworn to maintain it. Then, as now, th»' King was insincere, and refused to dismiss th^ foreign merce-naries, whose hired swords «oon overturned the new, liberal institutions; and then, as now, but few of the most notorious agents of despotism were dis- m^sse^; the bulk of the, omeiuls remained in power. The Neapolitans will not believe in their King as long as they see Swiss hirelings in the iort of Sant Elnio, whose cannons frown upon the towiu But they lack the courage to put aii end to this misera- ble comedy at once. They have no leaders: they harr^ho plan of action.- But in a few days the ex- iles will be mostly on their way baek to Naples, and among them, there is many a man ready to risk his life for the gOO<l of the country. Within three weeks they might succeed, and by expvtting the Bourbon, simplify the Italian.queetion.While I am writing these few lines, the incredible iutelHgeuce reaches me from a good source, that tile-French garrison of TJome has received orders to-evacuate the town and to retire to Civita Veechia. Should this news be confirmed, the revolution willbreak, out at Rome, too, since Ivamorieierels poly- civitlv concerned. As to tliono wbich belong to the State and the recoveryv.

Count Cavonr's position now becomes really em- barrassing. If he accepts the proffered alliance., he at once must dismiss the idea of accomplishing Italian unity; a dualism is established on the penin- sula, and the diplomacy of Europe will always be nble.to play the two .great Italian Powers auainst one another in order4o paralyze the forces of both. The Italians feel this danger so acutely, that the acceptance of the Neapolitan alliance would en- tirely kill off all confidence in CUTOUT'S statesman- ship, and throw the lead of the movement into the hands*of the Revolutionary party. Not even Victor Emanuel's popularity could survive such a blow, and therefore we saw likewise the first Italian Parliament, otherwise so subservient to thepresent Cabinet, unanimously supporting ths words of warning uttered by Mancini and the Neapolitan martyr Poerio. But Napoler n, on the other hand, whose influence*on the decision of the Turin Cabi- net cannot be denied, strongly insists upon a frank acceptance qf the Neapolitan prppOflfifons, since he fears that, i f the struggle continues in Sicily, aB the revolutionary elements will flock to ^^ribaldi, who might soon be able, not only to break down the power of the King of Naples, but likewise to dic- tate terms to Victor Emanuel. Russia, too, de- sires to save the royal family of Naples, and the Prince Regent of Prussia Is on principle hostile to any great territorial changes..*I*nn» assailed from two sides, | and threatenedwith the loss, either-of the conadence of the na-tion or of the good-will of the Emperor of Prance,Cavour sent an evasive answer by young Villa-tnarina to the new Neapolitan Cabinet, declaringthat if the Constitution should be introduced infjood earnest, and if the people of the Southern King-Public Instruction, La Loggia; Public Worship, Father and Bulgaria had subsided.

As Sicily is equallyfurious against the Bourbons aud against the Mazzim- ans, it was natural that the change now happily effect- ed should be loudly called for, and hailed with the greatest rapture as a triumph of public opinion.What people want hero is the immediate annexation of this eonntry to tbe Constitutional Kingdom of Vic- tor Emanuel.
