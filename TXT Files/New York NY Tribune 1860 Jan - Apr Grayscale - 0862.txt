From the time Mr. W ade made thia speech be has known no Whig parw, but de-• voted himself sonl and body to the advocicy and defer se of the measures, of the Bepobucia party. The campaign of 1856 fonnd him with bis armor on doing battle for the gallant Freo- mont. No Presidential campaign ha< ever received more freely the iovaloable Ubora of this champion of' tbe right than that of 1856. He was found on tao stump in almost every state of tne free North, urging tbe voters to taiespe*dy vengeance on the authors and advocates of the repeal of the measure which se- emed bberty to Free Territory.Mr.-Wade has alwaya exhibited manliness, nerve, courage aod independence. " In 1856 when the matter of the oratal and cowardly assault upon Mr. Sumner was before tbe Senate, and after Mr. Butler of S.

On Monday evening the Meino're left Mes-tions received the unanimous vote of the Senate. At tbe next session, tbe Winter of l838-9j the rage f'>r intertal improvements was at its maximum, and the credit of the State was asked in every quarter and Ixeely given to aid not only in general, but private speculations.
