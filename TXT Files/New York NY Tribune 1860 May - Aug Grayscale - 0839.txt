But his Americanism, on the whole, has been the great blunder of his life, although by it lie was chosen Governor. It was contray to the in- stincts of his youth and the principles he had always professed, and no man can disregard these with im- punity. As a Governor, Mr. Banks has made an excellent appearance, and, his salary being only $3,500 a year, without fees or perquisites, he has saved nothing, for he has thought it proper to., gratify all sorts of people by attending all sorts of shows to which people. could with a decent grace invite him. He has been fanner, military man, patron of colleges, normal.schools, and other educational processes, and I have known him to be good-natured enough to make a speech at the opening of a horse railroad in a country town. He has thus cheapened his office and himself, and, in my opinion, has lost popularity rather than gained it. His appointments to high stations have generally been good; but much fault has been found with some of his minor appointments. He has never fully obtained the confidence of the radical Anti-Slavery men, having disappointed their rea-jured, but none, I believe, fatally.
