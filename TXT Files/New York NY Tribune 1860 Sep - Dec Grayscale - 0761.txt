CORCORAN.—Yesterday afternoon,, in accordance with previous notice, the trial,-by Court Martial, of Col. Michael Corcoran of tho C9th Regiment, for disobedience of orders in refusing to order out his regiment on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to this city, was commenced at the Division Armory," comer of White and Elm streets. The following officers constituted the Court: Brigadier- Gen. Si>icer, Col. iS. B. Postloy of the iid Regiment, and Col. Joseph C. Pinckney of the 6th Regiment.At 4} o'clock D. Mettd, Division Judge Advocate, called the Court to order by reading the charge agaiudt Coi. Corcoran, preferred by Geo. W. Morell, Dividbn Engineer and Acting Division Inspector, and proceeded to qualify the members of tho Court, severally, by oath.The Judge Advocate again read the charge, citing Col Corcoran before the Court, who pleaded not guilty. The Defendant then read and filed a bar in lih-a to the charge, tbat the order W a s void forindef- uiiteness* the specifications not beiug eutficieutly specific.The Court ordered the room to be cleared to give an opportunity for consultation with the Judge Advo- cate, Col. Mead. •After a brief interval, the Court resumed audience, when the Judge Advocate announced that the Court had overruled the accused's bar in pica.The charge wa* again presented, and the question, "Col.C(.rcoran,areyou guilty or notguiltyV" was repeated to which defendant offered another bar in plea. He read his argument, which was very long, riting copiously from military law authorities and pre- cedents. In tl'ie outset, he set forth that the order to turn out on parade for the .Prince-'of Wales was void,because no sue! personage visited the country. This» Was followed op by other objections based upon theW rights of citizen soldiers, tbie duties of members ofment shull produce the draft, or a copy of this letter, for use on the trial. The letter is said to be in the handwriting of Gov.
