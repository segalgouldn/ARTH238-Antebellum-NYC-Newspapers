The Celtic population of the city turned out by the hun- dred thousand to witness the procession o f their civic end military associations.

Irish mothers, dreeeed in blue, carry- ing babies dressed i n red; Irish maidens dressed in green, and blithe Irish boys, wearing the shamrock em- blem; all, with smiles on their faces, and green ribbonsin their hats, stood patiently wniting, hour after hour, for th e approach, of th e expected dkplay. The Park itself long before th e hour of noon was crowded in the neighborhood of the City Hall with thousands o f people, and t h e briUianfc ktrtles o f red, blue and green, made the throng bear a close resem- blancefromthewindowsoftinsoffice,tothecrowds that assemble at the fairs of Southern Europe, whose gaudy minglings o f positive colore gcnr6 painters solove to depict.At 12 minutes of 1 o'clock, the head of the columneelf about the truths which that practical philosophy teaches, there is presented in this pleasant soil upon which I stand—this pleasant soil i n which m y t w o parents repose, waiting for the judgment, and which ought to elevate them as it will those dear ones y o u have lost, that }'our affection tells you they deserve— there is one thing about this land which ought to make an American blush, when h e will tolerate- f o r o n e moment the idea that there shall ever be one star taken outof itsflag,oroneconstellation outof its«lory.

Some one connected with tho house then sent them to Seloveris bogus-ticket office, No. 157 Cedar street, to buy tickets for California. Selover sold them steerage tickets at $-150 each, representing that they were sec- ond-cabin tickets.
