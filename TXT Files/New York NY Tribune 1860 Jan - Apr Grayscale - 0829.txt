J.—On Sunday evening, about the hour of sunset, the citizens of the quiet village of Redbank were startled b y seeing a horse attached to a peddler's covered wagon, galloping through their principal street, with apparently no driver to guide his course. Stopping the^animal, they found the owner lying in the bottom of his wagon, just breathing his last, with a ghastly wound in his right temple, evidently the result of a pistol shot. T h e man was borne into Atkin's tavern, cloee by, where he soon died, and Coroner Borden was summoned to hold an inquest over his remains.
