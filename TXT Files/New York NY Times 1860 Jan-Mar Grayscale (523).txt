Lord MauasBmr, Indeed, remarks that these"Slave-trade proceedingslent to the grossest acts of piracy." But, reprehen- sible as Is that tralBc, It is not piracy, nor is it equiva- lent to piracy in any of tlie le^ consequences which result u-om it. It is an offence createa by national, not by international law, and is pnnlshat>le only by the country to whichthe offenders are responable. The United States have, indeed, by statutory provi- sion, declared it piracy, but that Js a domesUe legola-by mutual consent, toe ntim)>er of guns were reduced, and small steam vessels substituted for sailing ves- sels, toe service would be much more efficiently per- formed, and the expense not increased.Tou are tostructed to read this dlspatoh to Lord HaLiiBSBCx;, and, should he desire it, you may leave a copy wlto Idm.I am, sir, respectfully, your ob't servt, LEWIS CASS.Oioiai M.
