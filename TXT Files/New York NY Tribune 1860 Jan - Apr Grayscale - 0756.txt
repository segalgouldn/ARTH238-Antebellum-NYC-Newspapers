Buttheoutragedandindignant public sentiment o f the Free States speedilv found a n embodiment in a new organization. All who were op- ipoeedtothismeasure,designed,aswebelieved,toex- tend Slavery, founded in dishonor, carried by corrup- tion, and healing deception on its face, rallied around the Republican standard. They consisted o f three classes, who had for years been arrayed in hostile par-innootherway. Theverymeans takentodenouncecontrolling interest—an interest above parties—keen to discern, and prompt to seize upon t h e opportunity to extend its power. It extorted from tho ambitious politicians at Washington t h e repeal o f the Missouri restriction, by the aid, as I verily believe, o f a scan- dalous abuse o f Executive patronage. So unexpected was this act of bad faith, that the country only awoke from its slumbers to find that it had already been con- summated. I will n o t examine the pretenses upon which i t was founded, for the delusive cry o f PopularSovereignty i s now rejected by every organ o f t h eDemocratic party.

T h e times are too earnest for such movements. I have befora me the address o f the National Union Committee, i nperhaps, for a generation. This contest is no factious strife.
