Coming to details, we note the com- mencement of an unfavorable ruling of wew York ex- change with this city, and the tokens of a (baling, both in Wall and State streets, that the minimum prices for credit have been reached, and perhaps overpassed. Besides these Items, there is nothing absolutely newof the money market, and we may add that there Is not likely to be much change for some time, unless in the event of a war in Europe. For all the peUtionl squabbling at home will rather deaden than enliven the money market, as it will tend to check new operations of magnitude.We take the following account of Boston divi- dends from Joseph G.
