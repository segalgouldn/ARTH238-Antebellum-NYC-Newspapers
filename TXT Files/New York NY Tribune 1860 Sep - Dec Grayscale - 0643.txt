The iuipreefcions de- rived by that Officer from a visit made to several of tbm reservations the past year justify the conclusion that the system adopted by the Government, tending to ttt* civili/.ation of tho Indians, continues to operate 8Ço- cessfully. Material improvement in their general con- dition is manifest, and many of them, particularly those who have for several years been living upon re- sources, already appreoiutmg the meliorating effect* which the pursuits of chilized life produce, are raÈ ported as having expressed a desire to be aftbrded tho opportunity of realizing the advantages of education, and instruction in the mechanic arts.The extreme severity of the drouth in Kansas is re- ferred to by the Superintendent as having been mo&6 disastrous to the tribes in that Territory and those ia South Nebraska, while tho Indians located on re*erya>' tions in. Northern Nebraska are reported as having made abundant crops, which, with toe annuities they receive under treaty stipulations, are deemed sufficient* to meet all their wants through the Winter.Disaffection toward the government and its agent* exists amoug the Sioux of toe Upper Missouri agency, ariring from the impression prevailing among them* that tlie lands they Claimed to own, have been ceded and disposed of by.other tribes, having no right or in- terest m the country, and which tribes, they allege^ are receiving tho benefits which they should enjoy. The consequence is, frequent violations by the Sroux of their treaty stipulations, which they justify on ta$ ground that they have been wrongfully divested of their lands.It is recommended that new treaties be negotiated with these bands of Sioux of the Upper Missouri, otaea* ¥wise il is believed that the observance of the stipula-tions'of their present -treaty can only be inforueafcy . resort to military iufluehce. , ÈJ.
