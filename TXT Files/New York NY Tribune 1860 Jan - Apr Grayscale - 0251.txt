Tribune."W ASHINGTON,The speech of Mr. Fitch of Indiana, in the Senateyesterday, upon the Slavery question, was rather, a tame production. The vein of hostility to Douglas which pervaded it, and . more particularly the colloquy between those two Senators at its close, shows that the old grudge which grew up during the Anti-Lecompton contest still stands good. In respect to some not over-complimentary personal allusions, Douglas re- plied that he was quite well satisfied with what In- diana had done for him in the selection of delegates.to Charleston, Fitch wioced under this keen re- tort, and responded, with more bluntness and truth than djgnity or grace, that, regarding his nomination to the Presidency as wholly out of the question", Indiana had merely chosen a delegation that might cast n complimentary vote for Douglas, but that he could neither control their action in respect to him- t-elf, nor transfer their support to a favorite whom he might seleet. Douglas replied to this attack by simply sayingj that he desired no controversy with the Ser.ator from Indiana, and was content to leave things as they were.The bearing ol Douglas toward Fitch to-day ex- hibited a marked contrast to that of two years ago, during the Lecompton campaign, when, in repelling the frequent attacks of the latter, he used to mani- fest rare pluek and extreme bitterness. • He seems conscious of the embarrassments that environ his attempt to creep into the Charleston Convention without disgusting and repeliing the friends whom he led in that campaign. . . .The speech of Mr. Hunter is regarded as the putting in of proposals on his part for the Charles- ton nomination. The peculiar policy of the distin- guifhed Senator on the vexed question, pervades it throughout. Ultra in theory, hut qualified with so many contingencies as to render its doctrines prac- tically harmless; propounding the most radicalPapal wrath.
