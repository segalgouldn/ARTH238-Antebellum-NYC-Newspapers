Whenitwasout some seven days the colored people felt the inspiration of theheaven born truth that they had been endowed b y their Creator with t h e right to life a a d liber- ty, and by the power of their own right arm they assert ed that right One of the slaveholders come on deck and drew a pistol. One of the slaves, named Washing- ton, struck him with a hand spike and bud him low incase, in which a cargo of slaves imported fromAfrica h a d captured t h e vessel a n d regainedtheir liberty, alaying the captain and thecook, tending the rest of tbe crew on shore, and retaining tbetwoslaveholderswhohadhadthemincharge,butdirecting them to steer for Africa. Instead of that th e slaveholders landed them upon t h e e n d o f Long Island,and the men who bad obtained their liberty were arret-ed, while the slaveholders were permitted to go at large.The case was heard in the United States District Court of Connecticut, a n d t h e decision w a a that these benightedaad degraded heathen, ignorant as they were, had vioiated n o law, had committed no crime, and were amenableto no penalty. (Applause) A n appeal was taken to theSupreme Court of the United States, where John QuincyAdams stood forth as their advocate, and the Supreme Courtmaintained therightofthesementoliberty,andthereit stands,that all menhave therighttomaintaintbeir life—maintain their liberty, to enjoy happiness, andprepare for heaven.

But the slaveholders of Georgia perceived that their complexion w a s dark, a n d they were Indignant that they should enjoy life, liberty and happiness. 8b they called upon the federal govern- stent to sand an aTmy there to capture them and reduce them to slavery; not that a single man of tnem could be proved to-be a slave—and yet two hundred and seventy men and women. charged with no crime and suspected of ao offence, were butchered in cold blood by the army of toe I'mted States because they loved liberty as you and Ithete are life, liberty, aad the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that when«<vsr any form of government be- comes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the peo- ple to alter or to abolish it, and to Institute a new govern- ment, laying its foundation on such principles, and organ izmg its powers in such form, a s to them shall seem most likely to eflect their safety and happiness."
