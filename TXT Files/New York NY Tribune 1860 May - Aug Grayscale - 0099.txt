The stage was •covered, with a green baize, and so arranged with a scene as to •present the appearance of a large room with two doors on either side. A t the front of the stage, w a s placed & neat desk for the use of the speaker. 'The remarks of Dr. Hoge were very impressive, and he warfiistened to with marked attention by bis audi- ence. The exercises were closed with the Doxology, "Prahe God from whom allblessings flow," anda> benediction. . • -Within the past few months, general religious exer- . cises have been held in several of the theaters in Lon- don , and have been marked with good results.
