Church, situated on Palisade avenue, was. yesterday, dedicated to divine worship. The morning service was condacted by the Rev. G. Lucas of Jersey City, and was attended by a large, attentive, and apparently deeply.intereBtedcongregation. In the afternoon,the hulpit was occu- pied by the Rev. J. Poisal of New-York, and in the evening by the Rev. J. C. Wheeler, who, we believe, ia to have the pastoral charge of the new church. This new place of worship is a neat, well-built, and (for the locality) a commodious building, situated a short dis- tance back from the avenue which gives it its name, in what is now a sparse; but, as we are assured, a rapidly- growing neighborhood, and will doubtless supply aSAVANNAH, Sept 12.—The steamship Chesapeake lays well up on the beach, and thus far makes very little water; one of her In tteamtihip City of MancftesUr, for Liverpool and Qutcnt- pumps keeps her free without any difficulty.
