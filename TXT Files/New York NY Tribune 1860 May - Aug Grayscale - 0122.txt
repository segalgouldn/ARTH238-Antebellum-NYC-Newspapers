If Slavery were an evil, it belonged simply to the States.i But Freedom and Slavery lad often coexisted in his- tory, and if either race suffered byit,itwasnotthe subjugated race. At the formation of the Constitution all the States were slaveholding, and in some of the Northern States climatic influences had more to do with the-abolition of Slavery than conscientious scruples. The Constitution recognized Shwerv in the provision providing for tbe Slave-trade until l808. He believed that at present.there was no considerable number of me*" in the South who were in favor of reopening the Slave-trado. Certainly there were none in Virginia.fShO bad always been opposed to it.

Congress had no right either to establish or prohibit Slavery by law in the Territories. If the General Governinent had no such power, the Territorial Government, certainly could not have that power.
