It was affirmed that, admitting the natural re- sources of Japan to be all that was represented, it would be impossible to break down the pre- judices that opposed themselves to a mere ex- tended commercial intercourse with foreigners. Its people were held to be like the Chinese, stationary in their ideas and habits, and but little credit was accorded to them for the de- spatch of a diplomatic mission here, the fact being attributed rfther to their fear of aggres-lutionary republicanism.AMUSEMENTSTHMmBLO*f» OABDIW.

Mr. Seward is probably influenced by the certainty which he feels of Lincoln's triumph, and also with prospective reference to the position which he expects to hold, and ought to hold, in Mr. Lincoln's administration if he should be elected, as well as with some regard for those friends who were instrumental in defeating his nomination at Chicago. In consenting to par- ticipate thus actively in favor of Lincoln. Mr. Seward is most likely acting under the advice of Thurlow Weed and Chevalier Webb and theothers, who, since the nomination, have been abusing Greeley for defeating him at Chicago; and if Lincoln does reach the White House, and Mr. Seward should occupy the position in hjs administration which he has a right to ex* pect, those parties who brought about Mr. Sew- ard's defeat will have to look out for squalls.EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A TITLE FOR THE SALE OI THE DUTCH CHURCH.—We see that the appli- cation made to the Supreme Court for leave to sell the property known as the Middle DutchChurch to the United States government, for $200,000, subject to the claims of the vault owners against the society, has elicited a deci- sion favorable to the trustees. Judge Leonard held that the order shotdd be granted if there are no human remains interred there, anjl there- fore granted it conditionally on a reference to take proof as to the fact. As the petition states that all the bodies have been removed from the vaults, this decision would seem to be all that was wanting to establish the right of sale.We have strong doubts, nevertheless, whe- ther Judge Leonard's opinion, even if it be ad- mitted to be Sound, will enable those who hold the i>roperty,in trust to transfer it to the United States government in such a manner as to pre- vent the latter being involved in law suits here- after.

The number given was a hundred and sixty, instead of one hundred, the actual force on duty. The Japanese present being thus increased by sixty parts, each member of the force was assessed five dollars for the Mayoralty election. Half of them, being authorized and paid by Coogres-, although ap- pointed by the Mayor, may be considered federal officers, and they do not relish this method of taxation any more than New York taxpayers do that by which they are re'quired to pay for the follies of their Common Council.
