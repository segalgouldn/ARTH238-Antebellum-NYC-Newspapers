The Use to Kurracbee required a submarine cable 1,720 mike long, all of which bat nowlaid. la traremng thia tike cable touches at twopcinta—Hillani and Muscat—on tike Arabian coast, so that tike greatest length of submarine cable frejm aay one point to another • only five hundred miles, thus rendering tbe opera- tion much more easy than that of the Atlantic cable. Europe is now in telegraphic connec- tion withIndia,anditisintendedtocontinue the line to Canton, and southward through the islands of Borneo, Sumatra and that group to Australia. This mag^Bcent undertaking will in ell probability be completed within a year: and* en tike British government intends to establish a line for its own benefit from Gibraltar to the connectton at Alexandria or Sues, England will toon be in direct and almost instantaneous coranianicntion with her Australian provinces. On the other hand, it is proposed by Colonel SekaJher, ice permitting, to ran a telegraph lino from the Amour coun- try on the American continent to S t Peters- burg,bywayof Bearing'sStraitsand Siberia, which, if carried out, will unite East- ernEuropewinAmerica;andwhentikeAtlan- tic cable is put in Unking order, we shall have a complete girdle round about the earth, con- veyingintelligenceandcommunicatingideasto its remotest parte, barbarous as well as civilized.
