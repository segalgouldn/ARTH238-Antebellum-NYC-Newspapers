The result of this sale will no doubt deptnd a good deal in the manner of conduct- ing it, but we are glad to see that it has been intrusted into the . hands of auctioneers who are in everyway capaole of conducting a sale prorw-rly. All tnat is required, therefore, is not to employ anybody to bid In the goods, as has been the case on more than one rccasioQ, and as our quotations have always been too high forithoiiewhogetupthesale.wetrusttheywillnowabidebyour friendlycounsel,andincasetheydowewillguarantythowool will bring its full value, but if there is any bidding in, w e advise buVers in a body to pause before purchasing. W e want to pre- vent, as much as possible, the repetition of what occurred at the last sale here, and to impress on the minds of business men who come from a distance that tho New-York Wool sales ore not to be conducted after the Peter Funk. fashion. With these remarks we leave the resritin the hands of the well-known aujttoneer, Mr. Wilmerding, and look for tho result with satisfaction to both seller and buyer. It is to be expected that the sale will be numerously attended, and if holders offer the lots without re- serve there is no doubt but bjers will be inclined to pay better prices than they would In case sellers reserve to themselves the right of withdrawal. B y aU means do not bring dealers forward onlan idiot's errand, therefore let sellers meet the market.
