Why, ragged old women sometimes pay more rent for their; apple stands on the sidewalks than do the sleek butcher8~for their stalls in the magnificent Tompkins Market. In Fulton Market n o peddlers can walk oyer the South street'sidewalk, with his wares slung before bim, for less than 12J cents a day. -It does look as though somebody was making a.
