It is scarcelynecessary to answer this question; for tho most tothoughtless mind must perceive that the " irrepressible conflict" which has disturbed our quiet, encroached ou oi.r rights and interests, and outraged our humanity, has entirely proceeded from our political connection with elavebolding communities, and would cease with our separation from thein.4. Does the Union insure peace between the North- era and Southern sections of the country? Should there be an attempt ou the part of the Federal Gov- ernment to coerce any of the seceding Slave States in- to the Union, undoubtedly there would bew.tr; but should any State be permitted to secede by agreement and mutual consent, there would be no danger of war;- thb Free States: would have no interest or disposition to'make war on the Slave States, aud the Slave Statm, in view oi their slave population, would ue>t venture to cemmehee it.
