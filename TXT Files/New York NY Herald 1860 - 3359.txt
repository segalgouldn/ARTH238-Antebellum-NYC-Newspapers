On the contrary, experience proves that nations, like individuals, are frequently stronger and better after having applied active remedies to certain local disorders. The real state of the case, so far as we are concerned, is that the constitu- tion of 1787 is not equal to the requirements of the republic in I860.

Now we have a population of thirty-two millions, with a vast territory extending from ocean to ocean.lowers of Mazzini are to be found creating a division of the Italian party in the name of the national champion, and priests and royalists are creating insurrections in the provinces, while the Bourbon King is yet the occupantcesion: and the mora] bears forcibly upon the present affairs of tiii.- country.lican party and foe majority of the Northern Tine Informs In Franc<ÑTIae Napoleon people ere committed in regard to theD y n a s t y .

It is presumable that foe most efficient portion of the force is foe detec- tive corps; yet we never find them employed,as they are in London and Paris, and other large cities of Europe, to follow up foe tracks of a murderer, by tracing him step by step in the commission of foe crime, wifo that sagacity and knowledge of human nature which they are supposed to possess, thus rendering ample service to foe community.Tbis daty one would suppose is the special province of a detective fores such it certainly is in other capitals; but in New York foe de- tective policeman appears to be the special servant of private citizens, who may have lostmoney or property by theft, burglary or pocket picking, and who can afford to pay for its re- btoration. We rarely, if over, find a criminal convicted and punished by the exertions of a detective officer, but it is very common to see stolen property restored by his influence, a share of which it is to be presumed he receives, perhaps in foe shape of expenses, or on someother pretext Now we contend that as human life is infinitely more than property of any kind, theof the moat active branch of foe polios force should be devoted to its protec- tion, and not left to foe Ñ i " ^ aad inefficient patrolman, an bas b e t s dona in the case of the late Twelfth street homicide, and indeed in almost every other ease of mur- der.
