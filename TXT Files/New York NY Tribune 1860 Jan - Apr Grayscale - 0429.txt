The substance of the decision is as follows:I k e suit is Crought to resover upon the interest coupons at- tached to certain bonds issued bv tne city. It is claimed in de. fense that the bonds were issued without authority *nd illegally, and that if they were not, the plaintiffs have no right to sue In their owu name«, because the bonds are not negotiable.As to the latter question, I am satisfied that whatever may be tbe common law rule, there has grown up a practice in this State of soing upon such instruments in the nsme of the holders.
