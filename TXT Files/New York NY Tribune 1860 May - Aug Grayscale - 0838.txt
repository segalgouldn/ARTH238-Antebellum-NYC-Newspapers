General Clary himself di- vulged the circumstance, complaining as he did of those to whom he owed, as he supposed, the reprimand from Naples; and, no doubt, the position of a Neapolitan General at this moment is not very enviable.fimi, Palermo, and Mehizzo, 1 can testify that Garibaldi carts more for the lives and comforts of his followers than he does for his own, which, indeed, he too rashlyunless the Commander-in-Chief |was prepared *o> surrounded last night; he was arrested and kept under, follow it up by the *trongejst measures to repress a n y a strong guard.
