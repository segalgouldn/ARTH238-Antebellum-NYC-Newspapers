Tbe usual results followed in Jamaica, to wit:— unskilful cultivation and dependence upon the margin of protection for profits, instead of good management in pro- duction and manufacture. But the withdrawal of pro- tection would notaccount for the decay of Jamaica, for protection was tost to the other islands at the same time, and yetthey allcontinued to prosper. Therefore neither emancipation nor the want of protection would account for commercial decay in Jamaica, which was uaquestion able. The Jamaica planters, complained that they could not get laborers, and said the people were idle and c a nattainthesameproficiency Theyhadbeentreatedwith kindness and hospitality ever since they left Chicago;but the reception given tuesa. to N ew York, h e tnought sur- passed ail others, both in warmth and also the excitement their arrival had created.Capt.
