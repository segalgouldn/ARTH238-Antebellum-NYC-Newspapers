So far as the bank returns of Charleston; and to prove the legitimacy of tholr trade show, nothing has been done with the money loaned they establish clearances from the Collector of the port of Charleston—at that time unmolested in its trade under the control of the authorities of the State. Why, under such circumstances, should not their vessels be allowed to discharge their cotton or rice in Liverpool or Havre ? We believe that they will be allowed to land their cargoes, and receive cargoes on their return. But suppose foreign nations, by the hostile influence of the United St-;.>- Ministers, should prevent our vessels from landing their cargoes, there is a very easy and efficient resort in the lution progresses, and civil war still remains possi- Consuls of foreign nations in this port.
