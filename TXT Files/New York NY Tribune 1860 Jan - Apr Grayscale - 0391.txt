HaJ^fct a flour merchant, was called to the chair. Mr.Peter Schuaz said that the object of the meeting was to adopt some plan to do away with Hecker's oppo- fiition. Hecker made loaves weighing 2$ pounds, and »old them fcr six cents, while the bakers had t> pay $6 and $6 50per barrel for flour, and they sold theirloaves, weighing a pound and three quarters, for six «ents. It was impossible for him to give that weight and pay the same price for P.our which they did. They wanted the floor dealers to unite with them, and with euch an accession they would force Mr. Hecker to cav« in.
