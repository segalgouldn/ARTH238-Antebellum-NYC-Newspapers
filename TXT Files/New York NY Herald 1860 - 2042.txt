This idea was scooted at by the blustering members of the committee; but those who suggested it replied that as they could not yet count their strength, they should not expose themselves un- necessarily.An unkind cut at Forney and others of the editorial fra- ternity was attempted in the shane of a resolution de- claring that no newspapers, other than those which boldly place at the head of their columns the names of the nvniineea, shall be considered as speaking authoritatively for the democratic party.A member of the committee suggested that Mr. Forney might consider this an attack upon him, as he had, in adopting a metropolitan system of newspaper publica- tion, declared that his paper was independent and the tool of no man.Mr. VACX (who has probably not forgotten Mr. For- ney's attack on him when be first entered the Douglas party) said if Mr. Forney refused to publish a party organ, of course he could not be said to apeak authorita- tively. . ,A member hoped there would be no further discussion on this point.t.ain^i COCXTS.ÑThree-ttftto of tto vote of this countywill ho gives fkr Ltaeoln.

The Superin- tendent of the .slaad being absent, I offered ita hospital- ity, which was gratefully received. The exact object of their visit I do not know, nor could I positively ascertaia it, sa we w e n mutually ignorant of each other's nativetongue, and could sot therefore converse together. I in- ferred, however, from some few intelligible words, that their government had heard of this island, and had sent out this mission to ascertain whether any of the residents were Spanisli sustects. and also to report soundings, weather. xc., he. When they approached the island, and saw the large nansher of vessels waiting for cargoes of guano, and on landing noticed also the magnitude of the operations,and beyond all, when the shipping bulletins were exhibited, showing tost 110 vessels bad been freighted here wiMÈ guano, they were perfectly amazed. and evidently impressed with sew ideas of Yankee enter- prise and intelligence. A chart and historical sketch of the inland, togafiher with specimens of the guano and chemical reports, were presented to them. They then left for their station at St. Johns, Porto Rico, seemingly well pleased with their visit. \The jtocht Clark has just arrived from Guadeloupe, witha cargo of water (9,000 gallons). the stock on hand beingthree days supply only.
