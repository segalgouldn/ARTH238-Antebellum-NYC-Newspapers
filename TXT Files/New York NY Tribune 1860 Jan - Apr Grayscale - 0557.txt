Owing to the large "quantity of ligltt material about the premises, the fiauios t-uread rapidly, and, despite the exertiomiof the firemen, the buildin/f was nearly destroyed.

To thÇse interrogatories they had responded in a man- ner that seemed to have satisfied the majority of the Senate. It was, he said, due to himself to say, that two results had, at least, been accomplished." First, until this time the public had never had a detailed es- timate of the items necessary to Complete the Park; and second, we have now the pledge of the Commis-¥ sioners that for the sum voted by this bill it will becompleted. It had been his intention to set forth atlength his reasons for offering those resolutions; but itwould suilice to Bay, that representations of gre*tfraud and gross incompetency were made to him by clared to be the joint guardian of her children, with ber hus-SKC. 10.
