One is in a building where a lire engine-house takes up a portion of the first story; a Civil. Court nearly or quite all of the second story, leaving the attic and basement for dormitories and cells. If the Court and Fire Company were both to vacate the premises, there would not be sufficient accommodation for such a force*as is required in that Precinct.
