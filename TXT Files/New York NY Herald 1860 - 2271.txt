Walker's expedition ia somehow or other cora- plieated with that movegseoJ. a n d h it ultimate design, after settling t h e Cabanas successionand t h e RuatonHonduras t o t h e invasion o f Nicaragua. Whe- ther be will over be allowed by the American or British governments to execute alloranyof his designs is a question tbe answer to which may produce some very important results. In a communication from a resident o f Hon-duras, which w e also publish, it is denied that Walker has the sympathy or will have the aid of Cabanos o r the liberal party o f the country; and it is declared that Walker is universally bated there, and that if again captured his fate is sealed.This movement, therefore, differs very mate- rially from the former expeditions of Walker. Our government has had its attention awaken- ed to tbe matter, and some of our veasels-of- war areonthe alert, watching the develope- ment of events.
