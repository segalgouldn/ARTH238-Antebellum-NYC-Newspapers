Ericsson declined to allow it to be sent to Cuba, for the purpose of grind- ing sugar-cane, until it was thoroughly tested here, icith live same kind of work. Wnen Messrs. Anguera & Martinez were apprised of this, they sent immedi-ately a considerable quantity of sugarcane; mean- while, the only mill that could be procured in this city was one with rollers 26 inches long by 16 inches diam- eter. This was geared to the engine at Mr. Delema- ter s works, and the actual experiment with the cane was made in the same place, in the presence of many persons on the 11th of January last, with the most com- plete success. The engines were immediately "taken down and Bent,Ñthe rapidity of she operationa and the facility with which the caloric ecgioe is set up being such that the cane was shipped .on board of the steamer Quaker City in Havana on tbe 5th of Janu- ary, brought to this city, the trial made, the engines and the mill taken down, packed and shipped on the same steamer, taken to Havana, there transported from the steamer to a sailing schooner, taken to the port of Marie), and there ^landed and transported by land and over very rou^h roads to the plantation, and there set up, both mill and engine; t£ty whole having been completed, and the engine and mill work- ing s&titfactorUy on the 5th of February, ji<Ht one month from the time the cane for the trial was shipped at Havana.The success of the engine was perfect.

For this work there were one hundred oxen set apart, of which number many died every year of exhaustion and fatigue, and tjhe rest were in very poor condition attheendof thecrop.These 12 ox6n required four negroes to drive them, and three or four others were constantly employed tak- ing care of the rest, and driving the changes from the pasture ground to the mill, and vice versa, and >oking them for the work. Tbe rollers of tne mill were 36 inches long and 24 in diameter, and with the greatest exertion the ox mill could only turn out, 12 bciklrs or pans of juice in a day, the bagasse leaving the mill with a great quantity of juice in it. When the Calorie Engine and its mill were set up, all those [men and oxen were dispensed with, and more 'worit was done in the same time, reaching to 15 pans of juice; while the cane was so thoroughly pressed that ia ren- dered 30 per cent more sugar than by the ox-mill 1 and the bagasse' in two. days of exposure to tho sua! wasready for the fire of the trains, v^hile drying tila<|ai^ the old mill required full two weeks. .efomju,aresÑTl ) present, water-works of Paris have b*en erect- ed at a cops of three milliona of dollars, and are capableai Scaleecc and Itaiy iet.
