A German Democratic paper was estab- lished in this city about two months ago, and after the news.of the nominations was received, it hoisted the Douglas nag.

TMs had been contemplated years ago, but owing to the want of sufficient information (wMch has since been supplied), it was not carried into effect This will be by far the shortest route to the upper country, and as the bus- iness of the Company, has increased very much by the large influx of people into the country, they find that some more economical method of obtaining supplies to be absolutely .neces- sary, on account of the competition they are now subjected to. I have not very much faith in the go-aheaditiveness of the Com- pany, and doubt very much whether they will do the work; but there can be little doubt that a good road up north would be ex- ceedingly beneficial to the country, however much it might dis- tnrb the equanimity of the towns upon the Lower Fraser. Of course the Victorians would be delighted, as the navigation be- tween the island and main land is beautiful for steamers. Vic- tMia being a free port, it matters little where the tewns are—the more cities and settlements the better for her.

The would-be assassin, who was well dressed and well mounted, rode close up to the President and discharged a pistol at him. The oall entered the, fleshy part of the left arm. Castilla fell, but immediately re- gained his legs, not, however, before the assasisia at- tempted to fire another shot; but fortunately, his pistol missed fire; be then threw away or dropped his pistol and galloped off. The President returned te the pal- ace, where the depositions of the witnesses w#re taken. The same night the deposition and the pistol were stolen from the judge's office. This shows that it was no vulgar bravo who was implicated, but that probably it was a deeply-laid plot to get rid of the Chief Magis- trate. A reward of $100,000 has been offered for the dh-covery of the would-be murderer, but up to the time of the sailing of the steamer nothing had been found out. Accounts agree in stating that great indig- nation was felt by all parties at the cowardly attempt. Bad as Castilla is—and he is bad enough—it would be difficult to find a man to fill his place just now, and his death wculd be the signal for the commencement ofanother revolution. ;•"'. .' v•;'•'•.;•': •'"•' Congrefs has just commenced its session.

The circumstance to whioh I wish to call his atten- tion is this: On the 28th of April, 1836, a slave by the name of Joshua Mcintosh stabbed an officer who had arrested him for some slight offense. The wound proved fatal, and for a short time the negro eluded the vigilance of his pursuers, but was captured during the afternoon of the same day. A mob soon collected, who took him from the officers, fastened him to a tree in the middle of the city, piled wood around him, and inopen day, and in presence of an immense throng of citizens, he was burned to death.

Thinking the matter rather suspicious, they gave information atthe Detective Office on Thursday morning.there, a gentleman from the store of Wise & Arnold, No. 12 Vesey street, represented that a case of shirts, valued at $50, had been stolen from the entry of their premises. Detectives Slowey and Dusenbury accompanied Officers Pike and Lyons to the grocery in- dicated, and there found, not only all the stolen shirts, but a quantity of shoes and gardening implements. The shirts were identified by Wise & Arnold, but the other goods are awaiting identification. Three young men, named Albert Meyers, Henry Smith, and Wm. Kline,were then arrested forstealingthegoods,and Wm. Hessey for receiving them. The prisoners were taken to Police Headquarters and locked up for exam- ination.
