Y., eight miles south of the village of Medina, on the Erie Canal, and fourteen miles from Bntavia..The-principal Acid Springs are three in number; beside those thoTO are six othert. Theyrre all located within a circuit of. about fifty rods. The.medicinal qualities of the Waters are fully shown in tho subjoined testimonials: They contain a very large amount of Sulphur, Sulphuric Acid, Sulphate of Lime, and PTOto-Snlphato of Iron. The great, uiediciual virtue* possessed by the waters depend very largely upon the presence, irr snob nnuaual quantities, of these curative substances.been signally successful.Opinions of medical and scientific gentlemon are given in thecircuhus. The following eminent gentlemen speak iu strong terms of the medicinal value of these waters: Prof.'Emmons, T. Romevn Buck, M. D.. of Albany; .las. McNaughton, M. D., of Albany: Edward.Spring, M. D., of New-York; Dr. It. Camp- bell of Pittsficld. Mass.; Dr. J. S. Shiiler of Lockport, N. Y. They rocomrccud the waters confidently. Dr. Spring refers to a case of Chronic Diarrhea of sevoral years', standing, which was cured by the use of-the water. Dr. Beck says: "I am satisfied that these waters are highly valuable as medicirjal agents." Dr. Campbell aavs: " They must be highly benelicial for all cbronio diseases of the stomach and bowels.''Dr. S. P . White read a paper on the subject of these Waters before tho Academy of Physicians, in the City of New-York, in which lie states that- the 'Waters possess decidedly tonic, re- frigerant, and astringent properties; and that the clasa of diseases to which they are more particularly adapted, are chronic affec- tions of the Digestive and Urinary Organs, and some of the Cu- taneous Disease*; Chronic Dyspepsia; Chronic Diarrhea; Chronic100 • do..... .b30 4P.g ...s30 48i.111150B O A R Ddo.75jfacturers' Banky which post he has filled since the res-ignation of Mr.-\ckley.
