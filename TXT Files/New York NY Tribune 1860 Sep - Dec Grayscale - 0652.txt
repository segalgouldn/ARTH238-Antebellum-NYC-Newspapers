This Administration, nettled at the result of the recent Presidentiil campaign,pitches into Kansas to vent its spleen. Groaning Kan- sas being at her last gasp, it basely gives her a fresh stab. Kansas is made the drain of the peccant humors, sad scapegoat of all the sins of this Administration. Williams petitions for Federal troops. The enemies. of Kansas are great on Federal troops. Have they forgotten the time they petitioned Gen. Smith at Leav- . enworth Fort tojust keep the Federal troops from in- terfering with them;//"just don't put the Federal troops on os, and we will drive every black Abolitionist out of the Territory in three weeks." After they met Gen. Lane at tbe head of Bull Creek, and fell back five miles to choose their battle ground, but did n't happen to stop till they had crossed the Missouri Kiver, and pulled all the Boats after them, for fear Lane would . foBow them, they then petitioned Smith very pite-<m*ty to let them have Federal troops, for Lane was gcing to burn all the towns on the border. Since then. the enemies of Kansas have been very partial to Federal# . troops. " The people of Kansas have risen," says Williams, " oh, let us have Fedesal troops; keep them ** off, do."Tins letter is already too long.

Dr. SAWYER on Sunday evening continued his examination of Dr. Thompson's book, " Love and Penalty," the main proposition of which is that " The doctrine of the eternal punishment of the wicked is in entire harmony with the paternal character of God." Dr. Thompson, he said, commenced his proof of this tremendous proposition by showing that God is a moral being, which he argued from the construction of the. human mind, the course of Providence in the world, from God's dealing with the Jews, and finally from the teachings of Christ. So far as Universalists were. concerned, this was entirely unnecessary. For more than half a century they had maintained that God was just, and that it was his prerogative and glory " to ren- der to every man according to his works," or, in the words of the Apostle, " he that doeth wrong shall rer ceive for the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons." This portion of Dr. Thomp- son's book, more than a third of it, he might, there- fore, pass over. The dispute between Dr. Thompson and himself was not whether God was just and pun- ished the wicked, but whether that punishment was" Almighty yeugetunce, how it barns, How bright"its fury glows;Vast magoxines of plagues and b-tonse _ ~Pi*f°Lie treasured for Hfo foe?."Far in the dleep, where darkuess dwells.
