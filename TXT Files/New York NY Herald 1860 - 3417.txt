The filling <r> of the deed was done by ThomasLawson,whoisnowunderindictmentonthe same charge, and who is charged with being connected with the defendant in forging a number of deeds. Sena- tor Wescott was a witnenMn the case. He proved that Lawson was employed by Rim for six years as a copyist andtranslator-,thathe wasaveryskilful penman, that be was familiar with bis handwriting, and that the deed shown him was in the handwriting of Lawson. The deed was sworn to before Mr. Stansbury, and duly filed in the Register's office, but it was found to be a forgery. The evidence for the prosecution was conclusive, and there being no testimony adduced on behalf of the de- fence, the jury, after a short absence, rendered a ver- dict of guilty. Counsel for the defence moved a post- ponement of the sentence, tn order to afford him an opportunity to prepare a writ of error. Mr. Thompson, against whom there are other similar indictments, was remanded to prison till Saturday.Kuncklem&n&Str ick - erTotal100dos30 48Bark Armenia, Hamilton, Constantinople—V Axarian k Co. fcaik Mayflower, Ouell, Barbados—H Trowbridge's Son*.

The sales embraced about 4,000 bales, mostly from store, including lots for export and to spinners, with some parcels taken on speculation. Messrs. Wm. P. Wright k Co., in their circular for the Asia, remark as follows:—Very little is said upon this subject, but from what we learn we are of opinion tbe quantity grown will fall short of 4,000,000 bales. The question of how much of this may reach the ports ooou- pies a large share of public opinion. All is mere guess work, and nothing can be even approximately known un- til the present political excitement subsides.FKKICHTS.—Rates favored shippers, while engagements were moderate.
