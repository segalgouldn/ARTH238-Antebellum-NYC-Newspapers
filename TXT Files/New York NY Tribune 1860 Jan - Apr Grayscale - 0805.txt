Property was in the hands of the principal chiefs. The cultiva- tors of the soil, for the most part, were either slaves, or bondmen, or small holders who worked on shares with their lords. They were often op-pressed by the chieftains, who ¥ wasted the sub- stance of their: fpllowers by turbulent wars and riotous living. Y et they lived together, in a certain rude fellowship on the estate, till the influence of Boman manners corrupted the habits of the lords. They became tared of the simplicity of country life, left their rural homes for the cities, and lavished the products of their domains in showy and expensive luxury. The ties between the different classes were thus broken. The chieftain became an abientee and an aristocrat, and his prodigalities increased the burdens of his tenants, till there was scarcely a difference between them and the slaves.The upper classes, on the other hand, were usually enormously rich, and devoted to a sump- tuous and idle indulgence. They alternated their time between their city palaces and their country villas, constructed in the Roman fashion, amid the grand or picturesque scenes of nature.

Many perished in theforce. The grammarians were mostly pedants, .critics, annptatora, and compilers, far more arid than a modern German professor, but with a slight portion of his learning and industry. The atmos- phere of despotism was fatal to genius; a decrepit and corrupt society retained no relish for truth and nobleness of thought; and the general mind, with- out the excitement of hope, lost all motive for loftyendeavor.W e will not follow Mr. Godwin through his mas- terly delineation of the fortunes of Gaul after the downfall of the Roman empire, and the establish- ment of the German rule over the nations of Europe. We have only to congratulate him on the brilliant commencement of a work, to which he has devoted the studies of years, and which is evidently intended as the crowning labor of his life. The reputationwhich he has honestly earned from the public, by his various elegant and substantial contributions to the cause of earnest thought and sound knowledge, has here found a monument worthy of his genius and culture. His artistic skill in the grouping of events and personages, his deep philosophical in-sight, his wide range of learning, his power of pic-the position in which Milton was artificially. The stock of words they profess contains more Latin than Saxon element*; but the dialect which they use from preference is in much the largest propor- tion, home-born English. Had words of Latin and French etymologf been proportionally as nameroos in the time of Johnson and of GibS6n, as they now are, those authors instead of employing twenty- eight or thirty percentof such words, would'scarce- ly have contented themselves with less than fifty.The revolutions in the use of words present aninteresting feature ,of their history. One of themost common examples of the change in our vocab-ulary is the conversion of words which were onoerefined, elegant, and even solemn, into those whichsuggests only trivial, vulgar, or ludicrous thoughtsand images.

Crowded amphitheaters shouted when some tender and delicate woman was torn by the wild beasts, or an aged and venerable man was stretched bleeding uppn the cross.Among the victims of this hellish rage was the Bishop Pothinus, then ninety years of age, whoso feeble body sank beneath its pains, Out whoee mind gathered serenity and firmness from them.
