Mr. Lorins Mr. Shaw possessed a mi ad ojf great mechanical in- of course felt himself embarrassed,, and consulted genuity and activity. H s greatest invention, theignorance of the owner of the field of its actoaf state is a tarnpie of the ignorancerof thousands; they are not yet awarke to the devastation of the worm. Hence, while for the calculation. I am about to make, I have assumed as above, one bushel to the acre for 30,000 acre?, I do not: believe there will be the .half of it.Now, then, regarding Linn as representing the ave~ rage of Kansas entire, let us look the case in the face; bearing in mind that if any crop of this year's growth can be calculated upon for anything at all, it is the corn crop;thatalltheothersareasgoodasfailures. Whatdo we find 7 Upon the assumption of 30,000 bush, of corn in Linn County, and presuming that there remains of last year's crop 20 000 bushels^-say 50,000 bushehi in all-—we find that to give to each person of the popula- tion the bare allowance of a slave, one peck per week, and make no account of the etceteras allowed him in addition, this corn would support the population but till next June, even if they could live on it aJone. But this is not snpposable. Let us therefore call the et ceteraseoxial in value to one-third the peck per week of corn; there is then but oorn enough to barely keep the people alive until the 1st of next March, while the cattle are left unprovided for. And it would require more corn than they haye got to fatten the swine alone. The picture is a darkTbne. I much fear, that the country will slumber over this matter until people here by hundreds are actually dying of hunger, and when no relief can.reach them in time to save. For, as an ave- rage, what is true of Linn County I hold to be true of Kansas as a whole. . /By^and-by, too, the rains will come, and if they oome before cold weather, sickness will be added to famine; and after that, freezing will be added to both. I am quite willing to risk being thought an alarmist if I canim see soaae preparation made to avert a calamity that to me ptems inevitable. If any man thinks my view tooldark, let him go over the statistics, and, if he can, mwke it brighter; butgetting" sunbeams out of cucum- bers "will not save this people.wholly on mere bread and water, and corn bread a that;: and death from starvation has actually occarred!
