Thetebe is made of Baltimore charcoal pig iron, the plates for which are prepared at Horace Abbott & Son's, Canton Rolling Mills, Baltimore; a firm which has made the widest iron in the world, shteta 110 incheswide by I an inch thick havit g been manufactured by them. Toe pigs of iron weig aabout 100 poaud^each. Several pigs having been broken up into three or four pieces each, as maoy aa are riequired are thrown into the i addling furnaces, with an. allowance of about 50 per cent for Ices of weight in pnauufa -ture. The muss soon becomes of the consist* ucy of dough, when it is stirred up with shoe bars, or puddling irons, very moch as a woman would stir up the material fox a loaf of bread. After ti e lapse of about an boor,- it is worked up into what is termed a puddle-ball, inthie case of about 30 iuches in diameter, and then by the aid of tongs and a crane is placed beneath a large Nesmith harjamer, and, after a tremendous pounding,. itcomesoutinthe form of islab2Jfeetlong by 18 inches wide and G inches thick. After being allowed to gradually cool off, this sla > is put into a reheating furnace, where it remains a few minutes, and is then taken out and rolled to the reqoired thickness, andthe ragged edges trimmed off by means of large shears. Tbe sheets prepared for this >ipe are 6 feet wide by 8 long, and ball' an inch thick. Toe iron uasd is reqaired to stand a strain of 40,000 pounds per square inch. Toe pipe i* 1,350 feet long, and 7\ ieet in diameter; the tallest man, therefore, would not graze his hat in passing through it. It will be made in •eciions of 12 feet, There Will be 112 of these sec- tions requiring 675 sheets, each of which contains 48square feet, and weighs 960 pounds, or 20 pounds to th^sqoare fooi.The first thing done at the aopof Sneden & Row-Council next Monday eveuiig.
