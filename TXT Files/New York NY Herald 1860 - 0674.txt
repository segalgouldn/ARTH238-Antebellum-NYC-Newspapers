The case of Thaddeus Hyatt, the contumacious witness in the Harper's Ferry investigation, was taken up,the question being on the resolutions proposing to commit Mr. Hyatt to jail until he consents to testify. Considerable debate ensued, and the resolutions were adopted by a vote of forty-fcur to ten. In the House the Homestead bill was passed by a vote of 114 to 66. The Committee of Ways and Means asked leave to introduce a bill providing for the payment of outstanding treasury notes, authorizing a loan, and revising the tariff, bat the House refused to receive it, by a vote of 105 to69.
