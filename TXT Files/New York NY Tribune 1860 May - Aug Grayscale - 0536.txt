It appears that the boys working in the place were in the habit of concealing a cake of ice every day in the sawdust beneath a bench which contained a fine cir- cular saw. Chalmers crawled under the bench toobj tain a piece of the ice, when one of tho workmen set the saw in motion, not knowing that the boy was so near, , "rating, and, the Attorney-General lending Ids powerthe tenants. Did that instruction imply that he was tothem. It does not appear that he made the motion, or faged in the trial of a cause which finished only the jot the order to show cause. The. affidavit was made ay preceding, or tho very day of the call of this causeWhile emerging from the place he came in contact • i . t « . with the sand which tut through the skull iu a twink- i : ling, ai d penetrated the brain to the depth of three inches.

And whether that order was regular o r irregular, it stands good until it was revoked. Now a good deal was said b y my learned friend in the course of his remarks upon the mfbrmality of this proceeding, and it was said that Judge Booeevelt held that they were irregularly o u t of Court.
