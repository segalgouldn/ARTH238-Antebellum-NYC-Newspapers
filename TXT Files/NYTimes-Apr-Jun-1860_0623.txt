Others say that a su.mounted Indian rode up and down the line of aavages brandishing a battle-az, which in tlM son, St turning, gleamed like a small white a.j Cspt. McDosALD, of ene of the companies la^ltet Uoody encounter, says the disputed arti. aia was a tin banner on a staff, cut in the shape of a tOBahawk ; that the man who shot him down h^ a telaecopa rifle, and described him to be one at seven white men who were marshaling the sav- afa% and that only at the captain's ordsr Im "bagged"lum. Thequestionoftheflagoftruce has been a good deal and very warmly discussed. OsaAK Daist, of Gold Hill, inclines to the theory fc»t ix was a true flag, and no tin banner or battle- ax &0B a Chinese theatre ; and this is the story that ha thinks the trace-bearer wanted to commu;pecfalyXi .A«ieala to the wlutes, viz.: The massacre at Wil[ uw. /Hams' Sution was Indian work, and for causa..

Thoughmoresinnedagainstthansin- ning, they Itnew what would be the consequence oftheirrudejustice. Indians,youknow,cantake no appeal to the courts, and proceeded to rendez- vous at Pyramid Like. Mr. Dabst tells this tale on llie authority of the white woman whom they put unharmed out of the house before burning it. If it is true that the bearer of a flag of truce wasahat down, no wonder the savages concluded the *' " orter waa " the krufs to the hilt," and preparedA' '^for an irrepressible conflict.Dia man who shot the bearer of the battle-az, tin .banner, or flag, was A. E. Eliioti, of Clear Lake. He got two shots through hia body and one in hia arm during the battle that ensued. When last seen tlist day he waa white as deitn,"bat making strides for the river.he to McDoRALD, as he passed, *'Igot two —of them white rascals and tbree of the Indians,"and pushed on to throw his rifle in the river, where it would be useless to the enemy, and to drown himself.Gen.

Mr. Kuio has fairly captured the San Francisco heart. At hia last delivery he stirred the hot blood of Irishmen that thoughthe Isle are so full of people of the Emeraldone of them withapinhebleedsjokes,yetIrelandhadpro- duced no first-class wit. All Califomian Ireland was ablaze next day, and the great question ever since has been whether Swirr was an Irishman or not. At the last fire the rest of the world rather had him, by virtue of Thacezrat'e argument thatthe son of English parents unhappily bom in Ire- land is no more necessarily an Irishman than born of the same stock in Calcutta he would be a Hin- doo. If Ur. Ktso survives the terrific onslaught for this sin of iiis, he will probably soon com- mence another course of four, for which I hope, as for the last, he will bag his $1,000, and net ashaodeome a sum for the that employs him.
