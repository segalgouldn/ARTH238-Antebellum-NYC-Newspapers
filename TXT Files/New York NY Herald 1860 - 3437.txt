Including Vienna. Madrid. Brussels. Constantinople, Milan, Turin, Ber- lin, Stockholm, Lisbon, and even the rock of Gibraltar. Last night they made their appearance in London, selecting the I'I lucres' theatre as the arena for the display of their powere. The enttte performance of the Crimean heroes ia indeed in- finite!vnovelanddiverting,andtheirtheatretoaveryaccept- able addition to the attraction of the season.[From the Morning Chronicle.]Last evening a remarkable navelty was produced at thistheatre, ia the first appearance nf the Zooare artists, the ori- ginal founders of the Uiealre at Inkermann during the Cri- mean war, and who, since the peace, have made a successful tourth pe. The eonnumber, and as there are no feinaies in it, the Zouaves have to enact the ladies' parts, and very admirably titer "make up" for them both in costume and voice. This performance Is very different from that to which we have generally been accus- tomed, but It is very genuine aad very clever, and we have no doubt it will enjoy a considerable share of popularity.IFrmn the Standard.] TheperformancesoftheZouaveswereascelebratodiothetheatre aa in the trench**, and the bravest of that bravecorps did not disdain to assume the buskin and the sock.

So successful werethe&a representations thatthey did not cease with the occasion, and the Zouave come-dians, by special permission of the Emperor, hare attendedtheir entertainments to several of the capitals of Europe.But after all, the most remarkable speciality in the whole en-tertainment la that the female parts are personated byZouaves with a delicacy and finish that cannot fail to strikeevery one as most amusing and artistie. The ladles, whohave been conducting tbeaaserres so elegantly and with somuch n licence in the mimic action, assume their real posi-tionswithgravityandvigor,andgivethewordofcommand WillleavefortheaboveportonWednobday,Oeccmher%,81in voices the gruffness of which.contrast moat forcibly with their recently assumed ones, while the curtain ia brought down amidst the cries and cheers of victory.
