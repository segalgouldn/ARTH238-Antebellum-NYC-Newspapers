Bishop Lochlan of Brooklyn, Father O'Neil of St. Patrick's, Brooklyn, Father Ma- lone of St. Peter's and St. Pauls, Williamsburgh, and Father O'Birne of Flushing were present, and took part in the proceedings. The <h;ldreu of the Sabbath- School were dressed m white, and with twelve of the Sisters marched in procession to the chapel. At the conclusion of tbe services, which consisted of chants, the celebration of high Mass, and a sermon by the Bishop, two young.laoies were " professed," and tak- ing the prescribed vows were admitted a* novitiates to the Order of tho Sisters of. St. Joseph. Tickets of ad- mission were sold at 50 cents each, and abont 1,000 were disposed of for the benefit of the "funds of the institution. This estate, which is said originally to have cost $100,000, lias passed through a variety of hands during the last score of yeai-s. St. Thomas Hall, as it is called, was originally built by the Rev. Dr. Hawks as a school for boys. The buildings, which are but ia short distance from the railroad depot, consist of school-rooms, dormitories, and a small chapel, inclofcing a large yard, well shaded by pa^.riarchal trees. There is also a large brick residence, with stables and carriage-houses attacbtd. The school-rooms require some fittlo repairing, but the rest of the buildings are ina good state of preservation, and the grounds have been greatly improved. This school lasted for ten years, but not being very well supported, the estate finally passed into the hands of Dr. Gildu, who, under n special charter from the State, opened afouiale school there. But this succeeded no bstter than the other, and the estAte was again sold to satisfy a claim of $10,000, and about one month ago was bought by the Uev. Father Birne of Flushing for $13,000.
