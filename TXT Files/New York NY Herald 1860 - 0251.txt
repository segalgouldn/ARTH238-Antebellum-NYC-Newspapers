[From the Parts OouBtttutionuel Jan. 7 ]We said, at its very first appearance, that tho pamphlet, "LePapoetleCohares," to which the articlj [irf journal of Rome] replies, was an opinion and not a resoluteoa. It is, therefore, vory natural that it should be discussed, tvtu at Pome. The attettion which it has attracted, aud ihe (. nfure as well as praise which have been lavished on it, are sufficient evidence that this opinion bears with it moi al authority. Still, while granting the official journal of Rome the right which bakmgB to all organs or pub licity, we must remark how tamentabje it is to make agovernment use such language, especially when the government Is that of the head of the Church. God for- bid that we should make the Sovereign Pontiff responsible for such an outburst of violence, eaually opposed to bis personal sentiments and tbe dignity of his power. t>i- dentiy, it is not the Holy Father who could thus hurl asathemas and speak of outrages " vomited" agatostthe Emperor But tins negative Is what the logicians calla ne gative pregnant.
