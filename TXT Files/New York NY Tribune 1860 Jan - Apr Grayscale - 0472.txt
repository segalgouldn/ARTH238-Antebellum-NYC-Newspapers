Suppose they should take sheep and horses from the Free States, the Government would be appealed^ to to cease receiving the stolen goods of the Lnited States. But the property of the South was thus stolen lo the amount of miilions. Yet no notice was taken of it. If he had his way, the sun should not go down before he would file a notice with the British Minister, that unless Canada yielded up the stolen negroes, just as she would be compelled to yield up the stolen horsesand sheep, this Government would use all legal means to lorce hor to do so, and if that remedy was not snfticient then this Government would declare war.

Bat, upon the call of the Governor of Texas, and upon the unde- niable proofs of the gross outrages committed on our soil, the Secretary says he has not hesitated to order a concentration of all the force upon that frontier which the exigencies of the service elsewhere would allow.Among the documents is a letter to Gov. Houston, from Angel Kavarro, one of the T exas Commissioners to Browmmlle, dated February 22, in which he says:" Although-many turbulent leaders exist among the Mexicans, the Mexican people as a mass are hoping ¥for deliverance from anarchy, and would rejoice in the Çstablisbment of a stable form of Government, which would protect their lives and property, and give them a place among the intelligent people of the State otTamauHpas."They regard a Protectorate as the only means by;~.which Mexico can be redeemed from the reign of anar- chy and party tyrants.
