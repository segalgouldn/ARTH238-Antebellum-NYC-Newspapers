Twelve collegians-, with their rector, all hitherto pupils in the Propaganda College, took formal possession of their new domain on the Quirinal Hill, for- merly belonging to the SUesisn nuns, and were addressed upon UM duties of their future missionary labors by tho Cardinal, vcho detcribtd America as being "the miserable cradle cf ettry kind of falsity and error." O n U M follow- ing day the American collegians, with their Prefect, were received in especial audience b y the- Pope. T h e official journal baa the following anecdote apropos of this inter- view:—After the audience the Holy Father deigned to descend with the collegians to the garden, and having stopped, in the passage, before the picture representing the well- known fall at St. Agnese, in which, more or less, thecaptain, whom w e found on deck, the arraugements which had been made with his executive officer with reference to the detention of Cooper. H e made uo pledge himself', butas bemadenoobjection,theinferencewas that he acquiesced.Before reassembling in the morning, Cooper, whom none of us knew, was sent ashore in the captain s gig, dressed a s a civilian, and allowed to depart uuatlenued for tbe city of N ew York.Two of the crew of the gig informed the deputy Health Officer that h e was the man Cooper who had killed Kilter. The doctor immediately ordered bis arrest, whichwas doneashe wasaboutleavingononeofourboatsforthe city. An attempt wasmade to detittn the two men who gave the information, as witnesses. The officer in charge ot the gig stated tbat that was the captain's gig; that there was but cne crew attached to It;that the captain's stewaru was outside getting some fresh provisions for the captain's breakfast, and tbat if w e would allow him to g o off with tbe steward he pledged his word that the boAt, with the same crew, should immediately return, and he thought the captain would come with it. H e w a s then allowed to return; but to our surprise, immediately on the arrival of the gig at the ship, and before the oflicer bad returned with the Coroner's subpoena for witnesses, the boat WAS hoisted np and tbe ship on ber way to sea.
