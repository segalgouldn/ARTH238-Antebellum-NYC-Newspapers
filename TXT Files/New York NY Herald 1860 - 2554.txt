The extreme portion of tbe abolition party are desperately opposed to the republicans and to Lincoln and Seward. They fear that Lincoln, if elected, will be governed entirely by the corrupt leaders of his party, Ike Weed, and they have evidently very little faith that Mr. Seward, witb all his extreme views, "Irrepressible conflict" doctrines, and so forth, will escape a like influence. The radical abolitionists, therefore, are issuing pamphlets •trongly denunciatory of the republicans, charg- ing them with hypocrisy, Insincerity and allstoc^ cperatora.
