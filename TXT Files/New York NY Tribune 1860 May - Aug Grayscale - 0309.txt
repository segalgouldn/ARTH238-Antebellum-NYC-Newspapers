It is advertised in every word and letter of Mr. Davis's resolutions, adopted by the Senate; and it will force jtself in o and disrupt the Bal- timore Convention. It is evident, also, in the defeat of the Tariff and the Homeatead. The slaveholders have no wish to conciliate Northern sentiment in any mariner whatever. On,the contrary, th^y are deter- mined to exasperate it to the utmost. Witness their, treatment ofMr. Douglas, who represents the North-ern portion of their tool, the "Democratic" party. They are resolved to thwart his aspiration*, as thoy have defeated the Homestead, and the.Tariff, andKansas; and th*-y will do it. Nothing that is product- ive, in the slightest degree, of fraternal feeling between N >nh and South will encounter anything but hostilityfrom them.These men mean Disunion, and are advancing direct-ly to, it, under admirable discipline, looking neither to the right baud nor the left.
