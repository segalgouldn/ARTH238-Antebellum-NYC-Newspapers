Subsequently he censtructed several other yachts of larger tonnage, among whish were tha " trouble" and ibe "Wave," doabUess yet remembered by seme of our older yachtsxten, the latter boat being without a competitor in her time. Following these was the OiifrabJe, which was his first attempt at a sharp bow and clean run; but Ms success was only partial, and it soon af- terwards was adapted as a pilot boat and sold into the navy.Two or three other beats were built by him after this, amorg others the tiimcrrtek; but un.iuestsontbly tho mas- terpltce of Mr Stevens' architecture is the unrivalled jacht Maria (now on the stocks, tn proiess of change trom a sloop to a ecaosnor), which It is conceded is one of the fastest ot her tonnage in either the old or New World.Tbe late George Steers, by hit splendid boate, also gave greai Impetus to toe ep-iit of aquatic compotliion which bad been aroused la 1839, a' the ago of six- teen, he built a sail boat seventeen feet long, named Martin Van Buren, which beat the Gladiator three miles In a race of twenty-four, and at the time created Immense astonishment. In 1841 he built tha owboat John C. Ste- vens, titrty feet long, which, with a full crew on board, drew only Tour inches of water, acd weighed but 140 pounds. Upon examination, it was found that she was not only the lightest, but in all probability the fastest boat in the world. He then laid the keel of the well known pilot boat Bary Taylor (for our pilot boats are nothing more nor less than yachts made prac'Jcally useful) on an early conceived principle, which he carrlod oat in every vtsBel he built, based upon the assumption that, Tor a••'CO, of whkh a moiety waa sailed for by the stoops, andi<sty the Queen, tbe Prtnoe Consort and vneDochessof vessel to sail easily, steadily and rapidly, the displace- j cars, Commodore Stevens tendered his restgaauon to thirty tons, started from Sac Diego on their ma. ieo r*eeKarlof WlBon.'ova r-f Tork....
