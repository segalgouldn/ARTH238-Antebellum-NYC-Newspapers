According to the strict letter ef the law, he has ne right to a s-at in the House Of Representatives, even temporarily, as he is there without the certificate of election required b y law, and his same does not appear on the return made by the Secretary of State of the members of Congress elected from the State of New York. He occupies the seat now , simply because the Clerk of the late Congress h a s taken the responsibility of inserting his name where it was omitted by the State Canvassers and the Secretary o State. Until the House is organised by the election of a Speaker, there is no power to correct or review the action of the Clerk, sad is fact the members themselves are not sworn in until after th e organization of th e House.
