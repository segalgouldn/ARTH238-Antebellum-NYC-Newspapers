But suddenly hearing -the report of a gun aud the rattling of musketry, and notbeing able to explain it, he thought that the surprise of the garrison of Forte del Cav-^uo had become a matter of total im- possibility. Major Missori therefore took the path of the mountains. Nothing,has been heard of <hem since, but we hope they are safe, and mating their wav through the districts of Calabria, which are waiting the moment to begin the revolution. By this time the Neapolitan generals must be fully aware of the first landing- of Garibaldi s forces, but no important move- ment that we know of has yet taken place on the other side of the Straits.

The father, Lewis Ephraim, makes return to this that he does hot unlawfully reclaim said child; that it ia seven years old, and begotten in lawful wedlock; that the child was carefully reared and maintained by him; that the mother and lie had separated by mutual consent, the mother at first taking tbe child to maintain and educate, but subsequently returning it to him, as beire unable to maintain and educate it; "beside which it is alleged that tbe mother is not a fit person to have the cnarge and custody of ssid cldld.

They lived together for some years, when they obtained a divorce from a person claiming authority and named JMiddetman, who, it appears, had no right to grant such divorce ' Subsequent to this, Mrs Krugg became a convert to the Christian faith, and married ag«dn.

News has just come from Bronte that Gen. Bixip lias shown the greatest firmness in restorinar order ajad in putting down the outrages committtd there by a band of ruf- fians who wanted to disgrace the spotless banner of Garibaldi; The ringleaders, about thirty in number, were shot in the square of the town. Martial' law was beside proclaimed at Bronte, and disarmament ordered under penalty of death. A war-tax has also been im- posedbyBixioontbecity. Thosewhonrealways calling Garibaldi and his officers revolutionists of the most dangerous character, will, I hope, agree with yoor correeponcent that they know how to nraintain oider and make law and life"respected. >While Garibaldi, is thus busy preparing to invade Calabria with an army of 20,000 men, the Neapolitan cruiserB are steaming up and down the Strait, as if they had resigned thembeives to play the part of passive lookers on. What is Etill more strange is that they do not even intercept one of the numerous boats wnioh are continually taking arms and ammunition to the other aide of the Strait. Members of the national com- mittees of Calabrian towns and villages arrive hero every hour of the day in the teeth of tbe Neapolitan fleet. I have just spoken with one of these gentlemen, and he told me that as soon as Garibaldi himself has set a foot on the Neapolitan continent the whole of the country will rise at the cry of " Long live the Dicta- "tor! LongliveVictor"Emanuel!
