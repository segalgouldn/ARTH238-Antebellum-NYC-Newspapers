But even theBritish precedents have found a critic at home in thelate Chief Justice of England, Lord Denman; and in the-words of the elegant and authoritative historian, whoselife has been passed in one or the other of the twoHouses of Parliament. I refer to Lord Mahon, nowJEarl Stanhope, who, in his History of England, vol.4, page 30, thns remarks: " I may observe, inpass-**mg, that throughout the reign of George U. the\u privileges of the House of Commons flourished in the"rankest luxuriance. So long as men in authority are" enabled to go beyond the law? oa the plea of their" dignity and power, the only limit to their encroach-•" menta will be that of the public endurance." Nothingcan be truer than this remark; bat Lord Broughamhas expressed, himself ia words yet stronger, and if possible still more applicable to the present case. " Allrights," he says, " are now utterly disregarded by the •**advocates of privilege,^cceptang that of exposing " their own short-sighted •tpohcy and thoughtless in- '" consistency; aor Wjould there be any safety for the "people unaer their guidance if unhappily their power " of doing mischief bore any proporti >n to their " dis- •*• regard of what is politic and just." With these re- marks, I quit the question, anxious only that it maynotbedrawnintoaprecedenthereafter..

He referred to the townof"Phenixville as oneof the largest towns where the manufacture of ironIS carried on in the State of Pennsylvania, and he states that this town, which communicates with the market, through' the canals and railways, has a population of 6,000 persons who are dependant upon the iron manufactories there. Those who go through Great Britain will be able ,to go into thirty manufactories in a single town, whejte the number of mechanics-midoperativesactually employed,in a single manufactory iron, is greater than the whole population of; Phenixville. ^Whoever goes through Great Britain and sees this great process of manu- facturing iron, sees railroads runnisg in all directions from the mites, bringing up coal and iron and runningfromtheforgesandfires,andtheblazeOfchimneys toahundredfactories,at all timesof dayand nijrht, men, women and children are engaged in the differ- ent departments of this branch of industry, and as you see them by the light of their fires at night, it geems as though the whole popu- lation was engaged in tearing out the bowele of th« earth, and burning them up.
