We know of no reason why Col. Ellsworth should reject the terms, ex- cept on the ground of the remoteness of the period fixed; because the ten intervening months would suffice to enable his competitors to attain the highest point of proficiency; and his challenge was to companiesnowtrained,inot to those that might hereafter be trained.
