Not therefore to the rifle rior the pike should the friends of the slave appeal, but.to the heart, the con- science, the reason, and the enduring interests of the people of the Shave States, npon whom rests the re- sponsibility of Slavery in the States. •While I accord to John Brown sincerity of motive, uneelfifrh devotion, and unsurpassed courage, I deplore and condemn his armed invasion of Virginia, Were it in my power to do so, I could not consent to attend your meeting, for' I cannot by an act of mine thus associate in any degree the issues concerning Slavery with John Brown's lawless descent upon Harper'sI send them as tbey are, as it is not likely I can be present at yonr meeting, and I hold it the duty of every one on these questions to speak out the thought that is,moment winch I can claim as myown to answer it.I know of but one thing that is to abolish Human Slavery—the same that is lifting tip the masses all over the civilized world against the despotisms that wereholding them down. It is the Christianity of anew age, which, freed from it's old corruptions', reveals the •worth, the capacities, and the sacred rights of iudivid-best men imprisoned in Massachusetts for disobedience to this law—say Emerson or Longfellow, or Lowell, either of whom'would harbor a fugitive—a glorious point would be made with the people, who love their poets more than their preachers."' T.

Mr. Fay was escorted to the platform by a nnmber of his friends, aW proceeded to- make a speech, •which finished with a set of resolutions exactly oppo- site to the sentiments of those who had called the Con- vention.

God will surely put an end to the crime in his own righteous and just way. Our great concern should be to act up to our honest convictions and do our duty. It is probable that no stereotyped plan de- vised by human wisdom will be' found to be perfect. The most we can do is to keep our eyes upon the signs of the times, and cooperate with the providences ofGod, as they shall be developed, and ' act in the living present.' Had it been my privilege to mingle in your, council, I should have urged the importance of philan- thropists and christians on all. proper occasions of bear- ing a faithful testimony against the sin of Slavery. I should have also endeavored to show the beauty and power of a union of Anti-Slavery precept and exam- ple in respect to the dealings of Abolitionists with free colored people of the North, the purity and sincerity of- which could be so clearly illustrated by subsisting them in honest Labor, trade, commerce, education, and in the principles of pure religion, and undefiled before God, the Father."Mr. F . B. Sanborn of Concord writes that he intends .tohe.present, and adds, among other observations: " To the colored race, the present condition of Ameri- can politics offers many hopes. Amid those confusions which the cowardice of the North aud'the .blindness of the South are bringing upon us, it cannot be that tho colored people of America will suffer a worse con- dition than their present One. Either by concession, or b y neglect, or finally "by their own force, they mustobtain more of their natural rights than law: and odious cuistom yet allow. And our own fortunes, which are so implicated with theirs, cannot in the end suffer harm from their prosperity."The'Kov.

About" seven vears ago I conceived of the idea of helping, by Northern subscription, such masters as, were conscientious in this relation, and anxious to get out of it, but were hampered by two difficulties: First, their act would completely impov- erish them, and their, conscience was not up to .that point of sacrifice; second, they could not free their Blavcs on their soil, and tney h'ad no means of trans-porting tl em to a Free State, or of giving them a start there.". .- 'Frcble entered the harbor of Tripoli amid the thunder The Rev.
