The Company ask holders of bonds to come, forward before the 16th Juno, and accept the terms . of extension..

The street impression is alsomore favorable in regard to Pacific Mail, the natural result of the lapse of time without any serious develop-pany is prepared to redeem $500,000 of its Freelond Bonds maiming 1st September next, and will pay the same at par, with accrued interest, on presentation." A.
