GOODS ON FALSE PRETENSES,—Some tea days since we published an account of tbe arrest of one Benjamin Lindersmith in Ohio, and his extradition hither, on tbe charge of obtaining goods under false pretenses. It appears that Lindersmith was formerly in business at West Bedford, Coshocton County, Ohio, and came to this city in August last to purchase goods. He etated that he had a largo amount of real estate un- incumbered, large stock in trade, was out of debt, and tbat be had changed hia place of business to Bladena- burgb, a small village in Knox County, Ohio, where he bad rented a store, &c. Upon those and other rep- resentations, he obtained credit of Boveral prominentfirms in the city. The goods were shipped, and upon reaching Bladensburgb, were transferred to confeder- ates of Lindersmith under pretext of sale, and imme- diately shipped to Iowa. The creditors, upon Investi- gation finding Lindersmith's statements of bis respon- sibility to be false, and tbe whole circumstances bearing; unmistakable evidence of rascality, concluded to make an example of bim, and proceeded to get an indictmentthey choote to,forego that privilege it ir not incumbent upon tbe Prcrident to force them to send representa- tives here..
