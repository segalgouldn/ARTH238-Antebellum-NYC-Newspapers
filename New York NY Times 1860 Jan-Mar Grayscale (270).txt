The leal greatness of thought Ues, not ia fiDdlcg oat a particular thlrg, though that were the pUloeopner's -stone, but in attaining to a larger knowledge of the laws unfolded in the working of the creation itself. It has been observed that the hereditary astronomer,JoawHxascHXL, has not betn lucky in the makiug of**dlseoverles ;" but who doubts his vast and clear in- sight into the subUmest of laws unfolded to humanlife. The ingenuous and justly-esteemed LsscAS- •AtjLT, using His ingeniously contrived Inatroments to study the works of the creation for himself, *«;>p«t«d to leo a planet, as Luin bad done before him and as Sicx and others had guessed that planets might be "discovered."
