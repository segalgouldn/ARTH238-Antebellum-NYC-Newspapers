The wholesale but blind commendation of early rising is as mischievouein practice as it ia arrant in th«bry. Early rising i» a, crime against the noblest part of our physical nasnre, unlef s it is preceded by an early retiring. Multitudesof business men in 4arge cities count it a saving of time if tlu-y can make a journey of a hundred ortwo miles at ni#ht by steamboat or railway. It in a ruin-ous mistake. It never fails to be followedby a want of general -well-feeling for sev- eral days after, if, indeed, the man does not re- turn home actually sick, or so' near it as to be unfit for a fnll attention to his buainess for a week af- terward.. Wlum a »">n lauxraa K^-«- —>•* « •* * • >g* "« always important that he Bhould have hl's wits about him; tbat the mind should he fr#sh and vi^oron*, the spirit live)y, buoyant, and cheerful." No mancanisay that it is thus with him after a night on a railroad oron the shelf of a steamboat. Tbe first great recioe forsound, connected, and refreshing sleep is physical ex- ercise. Toilisthe price of sleep. W e caution parents articnlarly not to allow their children to be waked up f mornings; let nature wake them up, she will not ed )tprematurely; buthaveacarethat theygotobedat;n early hour; let it be earlier and earlier, until it is 'ouhd that they wake up of themselves in full time to 1rees for breakfast. Being waked up early, and al-owed to engage in difficult or any studies late and juai before retiring, has given many abeauti'ul and prom- ising: child brain fever, or determined ordinary aihnentg to the production of water on tbe brain.•Msssansmasa; IB*I 1 *«JJ * .,PROPORTIONS OT THE HUMAN FIGURE.—The propor- tions of the human figure aro strictly mathematical. The whole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whother the form be slender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a departure from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks make *U their statues according to this rule. The face from thehighest point of the forehead where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is one-tenth of the whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end of the middle finger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the nipples to the top of the head is the same. From the top of the chest to the highest poini of the forehojidi is a seventh. If the length of the face, from the roots of the hair to the chin, h e divided into three equal parts, the first division determines where the eyebrows meet, and the second the place of the nootrila. The navel is the central point of the human body, aad if a man should lie on his back with his arms extended, the periphery of the circ!e which might bedescr-bedajroand him, with the navel for its center, would touch the extremities of his hands and feet. The hight from the feet to the top of the uead is the same as the distance from one extremity to- the other when the arms are extended. These are the general measures of the species.Capt. A. W . Reynolds, Assistant Cjaartermaster, will repair to San Antonio, Texas, by the lot of April next, and relieve Capt. E. C. MeLeau as Depot Quar-termaster a t that city. Capt. McLean will 'take pofet at Cump Coopor, and commence the construction of barracks, quarters, stables, etc., according to estimates,s soon as an.appropriation therefor shall be made.
