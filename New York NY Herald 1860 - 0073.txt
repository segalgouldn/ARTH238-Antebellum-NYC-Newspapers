Some small parcels of gold continue to arri?e from the near by cities; the supply from this source is not, however, large enough to make much change in the reserve, or to counterbalance the gain by the Sub-Treasury. A California remittance is, however, aboot due, and may arrive before this paper is pub- lished; this would again raise the specie average— which last week stood at $19,629,220—above twen- ty millions. The Sub-Treasury balance continues to increase; it stood yesterday at $7,736,%5, against $7124,181 at the close of the previous week. AIX>noAcchor Insurance CompanyPoDoI*>i*>Thos. M.
