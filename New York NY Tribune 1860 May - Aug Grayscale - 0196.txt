Hutchlns, William La sell, Jcthro H . Goodwin and James McCrillia came up for further examination, on,;\ charge of being con— nccted'W.ijh. certain store robl^eries, t h e particulars o f which wejhave before given in full.. Mr.LaselTs case wascalled first. Mr. Russell, one • of IUB cojunsel, in his behalf waived an examination, but said he wished to make a statement. They should not have waived, but for the well-known rule of tliis Court, and its rigid enforcement, not to assume juris- diction in eases where ultimate jurisdiction might lie i n another Court;, but where there was any appearance Of K'lilfc, to send the case to the Grand Jury for inves- tigation. They did not. waive from any fear to meet the charges; on the contrary, they were ready and anxious toimeet them, and were entirely ready n o w for the (inyestigation. And they knew that when the investigation did take place, Mr. Lasell and his asso- ciates would triumphantly vindicate themselves from • the charges which had resulted from the foolish, ili-adviscdli ithju'dged course of the persons who ha/I taken '. the lead against them.The complaints had originated with a person while laboring under.a malady for which he was not responsi We, and it would.be shown that these persona had. listened,to accusations from the lips of'a madman rather than those! of a person qualified t-o make them. And h e hoped tljafi this statement would be made as public as the nceu^utionshad k«cn.._ „'olice, Daniel J .
