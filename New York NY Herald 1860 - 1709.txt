The Russian Minister of Foreign; Affairs proceeded on the 6th of May to reduce the question which his government had raised to three distinct heads, In presence of the Ambassadors of England, France, Austria and Prussia. The Russian propositions were—First, that the condition of the Chris- tians in Turkey had become intolerable; secondly, that an inquiry must be instituted jointly by the Turkish authorities and the consular officers of the four Powers, for Prussia had no such establishments in Turkey; and thirdly, that the organization of the treaty of Paris, being mefiseleat la point of security for the Christians, a neworganisation must be provided for them.Mow, in the manner In which lhaee three propositions ofthe Russian government have been received by the Bri- tish and French courts, there really does not appear to be any material difference.

More probably a commission in each of the three pro-vinces m dispute—Roumrtia, Bosnia and Bulgaria—will act under the personal superintendence of the Grand Vi- aier. This expedient. whatever may be its precise details, appears to have originated in the French Ambassador, who has thus offered another instance of the desire of his court to uphold the authority of the Sultan. The foreign consuls, according to this arrangement—<o which the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople lias lent an ac- quiescence that implies the concurrence of his govern- ment—do not take part in the commission; but we think It wiU be of great advantage if thev accompany it, with permission to call witnesses; and if the Porte be wise it »• I B strain every nerve to grant the Christians, in fact,t equality with Mu«sulmans whk-h they enjoy in taw,toll n a f Close the tvwplaml of Russia.The great numerical superiority of Christians over Ma-hometans in European Turkey is a cireumstance whichhas long rendered it difficult for us to believe that anysuch extensive tyranny as the enemies of Turkey denounceran possibly prevail.
