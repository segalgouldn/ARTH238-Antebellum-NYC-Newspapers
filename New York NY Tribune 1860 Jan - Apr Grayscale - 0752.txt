It shows to what extremities the apologists for Slavery have at last been driven. They have been obliged, as we have so often as- serted mutt and would be the case, to follow close in the wake of those whose cause they have espoused. The Rev. Mr. Kettell is driven to the necessity of denouncing John Wesley as blind or prejudiced. By way of argument against any change in the rule of the Church on the subject of Slavery, he substantially condemns the rule itself as based upon ignorance, and as a gross ami unfounded attack upon the institutions of the South.
