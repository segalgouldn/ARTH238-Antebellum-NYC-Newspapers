There was ho proof that the prisoner had succeeded in passing any of the bills, b u t Recorder Bedford of Jersey concluded to commit him to the County Jail. In the afternoon, two shopkeepers, who had been victimized, visited the Jail, and a t once identified Redman as the person who had passed the oills upon them. Redman evidently was aware with what force New-Jersey law ie applied to such charac- ters as himself, and preferred death. Shortly after t h e two accusers had left, Mr. Layton discovered the pris- oner suspended by the neck, with hia scarf, from the door, and nearly dead.
