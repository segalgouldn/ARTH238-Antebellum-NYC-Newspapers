It is a bdl in the in- terest of Free Labor, and the more speedy Settle- ment of the public domain by it; and thus that Power, and by consequence the Democratic side-of the Chamber, will aim to kill that beneficent meas- ure.

No one on board, so- far as is known, was spared to tell the fate of his com- panions. All went down together, and sleep together in the same wav,er.y grave. It seems, however, that;the foundering of tbe veesel was witnessed otf Capo Sable by two brothers named Nickereon, whose ob- servations are thus recorded by The Yarmouth (N. &>Tribune :" At 3 o'clock, a man named Barry Niskereon, re- siding on Cape Sable, descried, exactly in the direction of tbe reof known as ' Horse Race,' what betook to- be the lights of a steamer. These liguts when first seen were smiionary, and remained immovably ia the same position lor more than half an hour, then they ap- peared to move very swiftly in a north-westerly di- rection, and, in the course of ten or fifteen minutes, became once more utaiionary. Mr. Henry Nickerson, who resides on Fish Island, states that he first saw theV light in the position which the wreca now occupies, a4>4 o'clock, and comprehending that some unknown veu-- bel was in dibtrces, aroused his son aud hie neighbor, crossed in a fishing skjlf the inlet which divides the island )'iom Caoe Sable, and, in the hope of.attracting* the attention of tbe crow, exhib ted a lighted lantern, from the higfc est point of land that could be found.'¥ The lights of the unknown vessel continued to bo visible until day break, when they disappeared, prob- ably in consequence of the fall of the moat to which. tbev were attached. As day dawned, the-hull of a laTgo steamship was plainly discernible on tbe ^Great Rip,' a ddngerous ledge about two miles" tfouth-west of* Cape Sable, the foremast gone, mbaepmast and smoke- pipe onlv standing, and the sea making a constant- breach o'ver the ship.
