It is now nearly three years since Providence hasbeen pleased to afflict me with a disease which has ren-dered proper attention to the duties of my office impossible. My own inclinations, when first afflicted, led me todesire to resign a position, the duties of which I was notable to discharge, and thus secure for it a more efficientoccupant. But yielding to advice, which I was bound to about, one thousand, and Lykens Valley eight hundred, respect, another remedy was sought. Experience havingconfirmed the opinion first formed, I submitted tbe wholeaffair to the Holy See, and, after some hesitation, the HolyFather has finally accepted my resignation. While I trustthat during the time of my administration I entertainedno determinedpurpose but that forwarding the cause ofreligion, I am deeply conscious of my many shortcomings.For these I hope for forgiveness through the mercy ofGod, aad I ask pardon from ail whom I have offended bydeed or omission. I pray, and I invite you to pray, thatGod may grant you a pastor according to His own heart,who may lead you in the ways of piety and truth, andPhip Fbepherd Knapp, Tovkv from Uverponl, wfth lost of main and miaen maata.•f dlsoaioB,b«*«ae he aw the constitutional rights of Hon.
