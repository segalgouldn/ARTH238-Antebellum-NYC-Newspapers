Three medals, called " Mott Medals," were awarded, of gold, silver, and bronze, respectively, and each bearing an engraved likeness of Dr. Mott. The medal recipients were Samuel F. Spier, Jehn W. Richmond, and Sam- uel W. Francis. Two descriptions of prizes Were awarded—the V an Boron and Metcalf prizes— consisting mainly of cases of surgical instruments. The first Van Bufen prize was taken by John W . Richmondj and the second by S. Fl Spier. ' The first Metcalf prize was given to H. M. Sprague, and the second to S. F . Ferguson.Dr. V ALENTINE MOTT delivered the valedictory ad- dress. It was a most felicitous effort, and characterized by marked force of utterance and happy and brilliant illustration. After indicating the medical profession jia the noblest of the professions, he pointed out the duties and responsibilities attending ajproper practice of the profession. Good drees and goodmanners were enforced as indispensable essentials. The address lasted over an hour, and the venerable speaker was interrupted with frequent applause.Benediction by the CHANCELLOR concluded the ex- ercises. ,The following are the names of the graduating class:ing prices; tho sale refe»red to yesterday w«s not consjmmatod- F n l t o n . . . . . . . .
