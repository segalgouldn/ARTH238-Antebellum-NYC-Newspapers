Bat the effect of tbe Ute vote in this State is not going to be HnVted to its influence upon our sister fitates of New England. It is destined to work marve- lous results in New Hampshire, where the republican party must necessarily coon fail to pieces, because of its great strength. The conservative wing of tbe party are negmnmg to feel that they are now sfHGently strong to throw off the ultra abolition element in their ranks, and the moment that move is attempted the power of black republicanism is crippled. Had they carried tbe State by aary a small majority, they would have felt the absarutenecessity of s continuance of political fellowship, how- ever obnoxious, but they now talk valiantly aboutcrush- tng out the radical influence in their organization.
