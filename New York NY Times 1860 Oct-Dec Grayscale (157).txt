These hard-working young girlsMechanira* and Traders' Kirk, N.Y. ;find it as pleasant to spend the evenings ""after their day's labor, in this social schoolas in the lafger-beer saloons, or dance-rdoms, while their ambition to improve themselves and to become educated, isstimulated by what they study, and what they hear from their teachers. Theonlythingneeded,wearein- fanned by the circular, to make the enterprise complete, is a better children's library) to loan out among the girls, which no doubt will be soon furnished by the public-spirited German gentlemen who have charge of the school. An original feature of the plan, and one emi- nently practical, is the devoting Saturday evening—that on which this class is exposed to most temptation—entirely to games and amusement.A moralist who hereafter shall speculate on the causes of our well-being and morality, will no doubt find them in great part in just such quiet, unobtrusive measures of humanity as these. Such efforts show an enlightened tone-«rfpuHic sentiment among the Germans, and need no commendation. We can only wish them a full'success.. .Two Cl.ntOTiiis or Tbinitt akd thk Pbinxe -A correspondent urges upon usbat the SpanishSeveral prominent gentlemen, just arrived here 'jimKiieniesandInterferenceinSaaDomlago, fromKinsu,denyTaiDBinsHtatt'setoryaboutsuf- aHiliigd the beUef that she is makini; fering ia Kansas.
