Documents, heedlessly read and long since lost or mislaid, are quoted from with fluency and conndence, as though with indubitable accu- racy, when the cirations so m»de do gross injuBtioe to their au toor; and tend to mislead the hearer. We believethe dooumeutB collected inthis wora are so printed that their general accuracy may bo safely relied on.By canvassers of all parties, we trust our Text-Book will be found convenient, not to say indispensable. But chose who only listen, and read, and reflect, will adsO find it a manifest help to a clear understanding of the issues and contentions of the day. They will be interested in comparing the actual positions taken by Mr. Lincoln, or Mr Douglas, or Gem Coas, or Mr Everett, asfaithfully setforthinthiswork,with those confidentlyattrib- uted to that • stateBu.an In thefluentharangue of some political opponent,whoisintentonblazoningbisinconsistencyorproving hisiosincerity.
