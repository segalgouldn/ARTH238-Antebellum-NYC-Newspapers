As tlie questions involved are im-, 9aTtant,;We give the opinion a second time.The money market has ruled steady through the day, if anything, rates being a shade in favor of the borrower, especially for short temporary use on strong securities. The movement, however, being a light one, as far as it has come to our knowledge. Prime commercial paper, especially if short dates, is not pressed on the market, and. BftkeCourt.—Rn.ro3,J.

Chi the return of the warrant the parties, with the best securities, can ootain all theyBUBttf had judgment, wtdeh, on appeal to the want at 6 ^ cent., while the range is up to 7. Ceatial Term of that (Jourt, was reversed and judg-Boeat iSnally given for tike defendant, upon the grouad, Foreign Exchange Ls not yet fairly opened for the a* it seama, that the affidavit on which the attaS^mieatwas granted did not state suiScient to auttiorize the issuing of such a process, and that.tlierefore, the Cour acquired no juiisoietion of the suit. On the reversal the General Term awajded the defendant $48 86 costsaaddlsbursments,,and forwtiich judgment has been •Btered.The plaintiff having appealed, asks us to review the judgment ta yesBect to tne sufficiency of the affidavit referred to ; and also as to the right of the Mariae CkHirt to award the costs thus imposed upon iiim.next steamer ; but the tendency appears to be to- ward easier rates.

The act of July 21, 1853, (Laws1853,p.l.ltiS.)underwhichtii^ MarineCourt derives the power to review upon appeal at General Term the judgments rendered by any of its Justices,allows (sec. 5) the same costs and disbursements on such appealsason appeals from Justices* Courts to thisOsort ; azid these areCode, wliich proides that there shall only he allmred on such appeals to the ap- yellant on reversal $15, and to the respond- eat • on affirmance 912, with the fees of officersand disbursements in addition, wliich consist of the BherttPa or Constable's fees, and the sums paid to the clerk dnitng the [progress of the cause, or for any copies of papers made by him an^ necessary to be procured, tc^etiier with the expenses incident to the aUsgofanytranscriptofthejudgment. Theseitems, added to the Jostlee's fee of $3, for his return, consti- tute all the fees of officers and disbursements which can be allowed by us on appeal from Justice's Court, aad it follows that the Jiartae Court cannot, under the provisions of the act of 1853 referred to, allow any other.But It is aid that, tf a iv\e of that Court, an ap- peUan^.nqai^ to print Ilia ease aad points upon an ftitl taken to the GeneraTTerm, and that tliis expeuia mitf therdfon be considered as a necessary dMmtsement, to be allowed as part of thecosutobe awarded in flie final jndmnent.Oar only aaawer to thU if, that the Legislature has raetri^ed this Court in the amount of costs and dis- bursements which we may award upon appeaLs from Jostiees' Conrts ; and the Marine Court, as already ahown, is restricted in like manner and to the sune extent By Section S65 of the Code, wn are required «»hearansochappealsupontheoriginal papers,and Itis therein expressly declared ttiat no copy thereof need lie ftonlshed for the uu of the Court.A pHUliliiii of so positivfl a ctiaracter we have al- wna nypoKd denied to us the right to impose jpou cftther'party to such appeals any expense in the way ofeithMcaarafngorpnntlng of papers to be used in tteanmaent of the qn>eais before us, and we havedooliuat If we sliould require such an expense to he nndMguue. the party incurring it would not be en- titledtotore aliowedhimasadisbursementwithinBWaMinVtl- ma *iews, we are of opinion that in he Marin* Court has exceeded itsin)favor of the defendant eweanvefnaftfarc^tataijahmMdmngtnaiofefioioatattaaiaiaddlibanaments thantiie law anfhorivitThe jDdgraent must, therefore, be Teduced to theeasts »fti< ^fat^rnnn^atf ^if '•'' nrnnttlty allaw^d in this Coort on appeals from Jostioes' Cot^ts, and thus modified,Hwluheaffirmedwlttioutcostsofthis ap- peal to stther party., SCrEKlIE COUBT—CHAMBEB8.Lkonard, J,—Aonevs. 7Vtm£^—Motion Krtnt-gi& Co. state that no cliange had occurred in Amer- ican Stocks during the -week, only a small business being done, and the remarks of Messrs.
