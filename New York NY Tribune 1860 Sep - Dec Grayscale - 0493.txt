The sixth resolution denies the right of the Colonial Minister " to interfere directly o r indirectly i n t h e public affairs of this country," the previous resolutions haying asserted that there was interference, and declares that the Grand Lodge " holds the Provincial Ministers responsible for alfthe acts performed in the Queen's name byherMajesty'srepresentativeinthis colony," and that " if anv advice was tendered, and attempted to be enforced" which interfered with tho 44 lc^al rights'' of the subject, the Ministers " Apuld have resigned their trust." The4i advice" reforrw to was that given by the Governor-General to the Mayors of •Kingston ana Toronto to prevent tho presence of Orangemen in the procession to welcome the Prince! This is held to have been an interference with th# "legal rights" of the subject which the Ministry ought to have prevented by a resignation." They did not resign, and therefore, in the opinion of the Grand Ixnlge, they sacrificed •*the liberties of the people of whose constitutional rights they are for the tune being the appointed custodians."
