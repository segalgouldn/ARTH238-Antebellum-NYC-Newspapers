Itisevident that this plan of effecting a n escape has long been thought o f by him, and to his hopes of success may be attributed hiscalmnessoflate. Thedetectionofhisplans, andthe dissipation of his virions of liberty, have resulted in an ntter prostration of mind and body.Beforehisarrest, Stephens waaa zealous church member,a communicant ofthe Methodist Episcopal C h u r c h , a n d a c l a s s l e a d e r .

Tne Governor •was co far influenced b y the representations made to kim thm he promised to com-ider the matter and to tele-graph a n answer t o M r . Knapp yesterday morning. . Other influences had been brought to bear on the Gov- ernor, and it is the general impression that he wouldhave acceded t o the request f o r a respite. The plan ofescapehavingbeendefected, Mr.Koappsawthe pablished account yesterday morning, and a t once tele- graphed to the Governor requesting him to blot from. his memory all remembrance o f tucir late interview, and to forget all the arguments h e had used in behalf of i&epbens.
