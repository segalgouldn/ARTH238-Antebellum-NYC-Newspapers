Oftenoriginating in carelessness, or sedentary habits, it is regarded as aaughtdisorderoftoolittleconsequenoetoexciteanxiety,while in reality it is the precursor and companion of many of the most fatalanddangerousdiseases,and unless earlyeradicatedifwill brinethesufferertoanuntimelygrave.Amongthelighterevils ofwhichcostivenesbisthousualattendantareHeadache,Colic, Rheumatism,FoulBreath,Piles,andothersofHkonature,while a long train of frightful diseases such as Malignant Fevers, Ab- cosses,Dysentery,Diarrhea,Dyspepsia,Apoplexy,Epilepsy, Paralysis,HysteriB,Hypochondriasis,Melancholy,andInsanity first indicate their presence in the system by this alarming symp-tom.

Fromalltheseconsiderationsit followsthatthedisordershouldreceiveimmodiateattention whenever it occurs, and no person should neglect to get a box of Cephalic Pills on the first appearance o f the complaint,, as their timely use will expel the insidious approaches of disease and destroy this dangerous foe to human life.•THISAFTERNOON,.'
