This is specially Important to taxpayers, as, unless they have fully comprehended the authoritative definition of the word, they may lind their property sold over their beads, for some imheard- of improvement. The streets of New-York, as they used to be, comprised tbe space betereen opposite bouses, but the sapient representatives of the million of residents in New-York have found a distlncdon withoutadifference. ByvirtueofStatelawsand ordinances, all of recent date, the streets of New- York have been subdivided Into three departments. To the Croton Aqueduct Board Is intrusted the careof paving, repairing or repavhag them ; to the Street Department is aaottad the wot of laying curb and stones and repairing the same, also of grao- erand to the City Inspector Is given the awful re- sponsibility of cleaning them. Then—thanks to tbe Circumlocution system adopted by our City Fathers— If a gentleman or a neighborhood require a street to b«paveo,evcn at their own expense, they have i'. consult the buads of these departments, eaoh of which must act inuepei'dently of tiie other. If the Croton Board award a contract for paving a street, it can only be dure with tbe assent of the Street Commis- !«««. / sioner,whoregulatesthecurbingandguttering, and s'l on, ad ijw/inxium.
