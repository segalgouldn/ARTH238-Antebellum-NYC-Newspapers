Some of tbe best barley, counties have nearly aban- doned Hpring bailey, the.fairoera turning their attention to Win- ter barley, which i» a more sure arid profitable crop. The av- erage yi* Id of Spring bsrley is estimated at L3®20 bush. & acre; tbat of Winter at 35050 hush. The large proportion of. Winter barley will probably bring the aggregate crop of this State nearly up to that of last y*ar. In most COtintles, Spring oarlpy is rep- rcfented as light and poor-. Winter as hea«y and good. Califor- nia has a vood crop, but not much of it will come here, unless prices should rule much higher than there is any probability of at present. The high prices current in October, lf»58, brought 500'00 bu»h. of California barley to this martet. Last year's receipts from that quarter did not exceed 40,000 bush. The bar- ley crop of l£60 will undoubtedly exceed that of 1*59 in quantity, but tbe average quality wi'l be inferior to the list crop. TheT»)k>w in mcdeiate demand at nnchsngei rates.
