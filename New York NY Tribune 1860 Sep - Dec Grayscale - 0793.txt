The'levee and streets are crowded with teams from tbe interior,'that have' come a distance of from fifty to two hundred miles, to obtain' a scanty modicum of assistance. On Saturday there were at least fifty such wagons camped around and on tho levee, waiting the time when they might get a part of a load at least. Gaunt, hungry, lean oxen, and even still gaunter, leaner, hungrier-looking men, with their coarse, patched, and ragged garments, shredded to the Wintry wind, were the principal features of the scene. The disbursing agent's (Gen. Fomeroy) office is crowded constantly with these men, hardy, toil-worn pioneers, who, on the frontiers of civilization have for years been blazing the pathway of free institutions across the vast prairies of the .Continent. They are the men who, rough-banded, sturdy, and independent, would scorn the county of ojhers while the shadow of hope lay upon them. Tbey come, here representing their neighbors, even more^ destitute than they, leaving wives and children behind, with but a day. or two's fapply of food, anxiously watching for their return. They ccme with their half starved oxen, long distan- ces', across tracts of conntry destitute of fodder, and where soon it can neither be begged, borrowed, or.bought.
