I t was the inteution to return to the Battery, and there open the tranks, i n order to prove to whomsoever it might concern that no water could get inside, and to show the efficacy of this arrangement as a life-saviog apparatus in case of ship- wrecks at sea.

Bei ig well made of very thick sole leather, ribbed with steel, shut very tightly b y means of Iidia-rubber borders between the lid and body, tbe trunks were found quite dry. Each trunk, according to the estimate o f Lazare Cantel, the manu- facturer, will bear up four persons o f ordioary weight.
