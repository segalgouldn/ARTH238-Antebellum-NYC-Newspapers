The noon train from Albany Biarted on the Central Bead to-day', with nine passenger cars crowded with delegates.

On reaching Fonda the full extent of the violence of the storm was seen. The lain bad almost ceased, but the traik was in places a foot under water." Almost the entire village of Fonda was one or two feet under, wafer, and when the train stopped at the station, two or three delegates, anxioua to catch tbe cars, were seen wading through the sub-merged streets hip deep in water.The train 1 rft the depot on time, but on arriving attbe first bridge, a short diatahce west, the creek wasfound swollen to a tor ent, and the bridge for sixtyfeet swept away.

T., ang. 13, i860. 3I notice in your issue of Aug. 4 a letter from some person, signing himself " C H S . , " written from Mound City, Linn County, Kansas—$he writer c€j which calls very frequently upon God to witness to bis truth, and also for Hhn (God) to tell him whether the people " o f poor, down-trodden, long-euffering, " a n d now forsaken Kansas," may not have a faint hope " t h a t some Eastern American will make t h e" moVe to have provisions and clothing forwarded t o "tbe suffering poor of this Territory." He might' have said God-forsaken, so far as beJe concerned, as ft is a matter of considerable doubt wnether such prolific scribblers for foreign aid are ever kuown to God, much le*s visited by His mercifol providence.Fearing that the "Eastern American" may not allow his " bowels of compassion" to be moved, and *? move to have provisions and clothing forwarded t« " the suffering poor of this Territory,'* I iados'* threecents to bead the list of contributions; also, another t a pay for forwarding it to " C.
