That defendants, who have been misled by the acts or negligence of the officers of the company, and have advanced money in consequence thereof, are entitled to recover damages against the company in a proper action.81. That persons holding certificates of Stock, valid when they were issued, accompanied by an assignment and power, on which they have advanced money, may recover damages against the company when such certifi- cates have been rendered of no value by the allowance of transfers oa the books of the company, without requiring the surrender of the certificates.22. That such damages cannot be recovered in this ac- tion by way of counter claim.That the following rules must be adopted, as to these paration of the stock :—1. Tbe certificates are to be rejected where a transfer of the stock or shares mentioned therein has been made oa the books, and tbe certificates, with power attached, nave ceased to be of value, where ail the stock held by ti;e party at the date thereof has been transferred.the transfers on the books of the company are valid, even without the sarreadcr of the certi-ficate at the time of the transfer.3. That transfers only convey the legal title to atoekheld by the party at the time of making the traaafer.4. That transfers made oa tbe same day oa which the stock is received are valid and convey tbe title, although the transfer to the party is entered in the transfer book, on a transfer of a prior number than that by which he received the stock, provided tbe date of both transfers isthe same.5. That transfers by power of attorney can onjy conveystock beki by the party executing the power of attorney at tbe time of its execution, aad in tbe absence of any- other proof the date of the power must be taken as such time. If there is no date to tbe power and no proof of its esecuticn, tbe date of the tranter by tbe attorney most goeern. ^6. If all the stock held at the date of toe power has been transferred by the party giving the power, before the attorn • v makes the transfer, no stock would pass un- der such t.anfafer, and the same is to be disregareed.7. TV same rate must be applied to outstanding certifi- cates .aid powers, where uo transfer has been made by the attorney, anc where ».i equitable title exists in tbe holder of the same, aad if M stock held by the party giving the |*»wer at the date thereof has been transferred, sneh power and certificate cease to be of any value, and" ":.
