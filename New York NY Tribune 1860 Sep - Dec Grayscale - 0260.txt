He hadnoiaterestin so doing on account of his agency for the Tarquin. Ou the contrary, as I have before stated, tbe claim of the Tarquin would probably have amounted to a larger sum than $28;000 if the Commission had not been ex-tended at all. .At that time it was a common thing for lawyers iu Congress as well as out of it to prosecute claims before .Commissioners, and I had never hea'd its impropriety, hinted. My friend, the Hon. John W .

It bad. nothing whatever to do with Congressional action, and any interest he might have in a claim could not have affected his conduct as a legislator. Both Mr. Hamlin and Mr. Houston, in all th*ir intercourse with me as Commissioner, never acted otherwise than as gentlemen of the highest honor and integrity should have acted.
