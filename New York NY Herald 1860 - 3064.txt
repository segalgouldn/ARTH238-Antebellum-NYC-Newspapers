It was a spiritualem-thla policy unwise upon the part ot both coufftries, anddisadvantageous to both. England had made such laws,and she had seen the folly and error of them. The differential duties of Canada upon the commerce of both oountrieshe believed to be injurious to both. He believed that if theUnited States would make concessions in respect to her laketrade, Canada would throw down the barriers against thetake trade, and make liberal reductions upon t h e tariffupon American goods. T h e laws o f England respecting'lighthouse does, pilotage, &o, be deemed unfair andun-generous, but be believed that if concessions were made from us.

Thetaxable property in the State of South Carolinawas valued, at the time the last census was taken,at $288,257,694, of which about $175,000,000 wasin slaves. What part of this property would betaxed to raise the ten millions of dollars that wouldbe required during the first year of independence? srCARS ÑThe market was heavy, though without fur-can vessels, while Canadian laws forbid that It should b ejustreferredto. Hebelievedthatthecommercialinto rests ot England and America were mutual, and he urged the removal o f t h e restrictions which h a d been made when the interests of the two nations were distinct and at variance with each other, and when there was a nar- row jealousy. The speaker then referred to the repeal of the ravtgatlon laws of England, and urged that free trade bad been of great importance to Great Britain. H e then west Into an elaborate argument to prove that free trade had been of immense advantage to England, and he in- terred that the United States would reap aneiual degree of advantage from the pursuit of the same policy.goldwhichwearelikelytosendtoNewOrleans. The Sub-Treasury continues to gain money; the balance last evening stood at $5,736,748, against $5,639,268 at the close of last week, and 14,608,- 687 at the corresponding date last year. The bank discounts will probably show a curtailment to- morrow. The Last average w as $125,231,814, an increase of $1,871,958 from the week previous. A t the corresponding date last year the banks had loaned $120,118,037. The withdrawal of deposits, in consequence of the shipments of gold to the South, will probably have admonished the banks to stop the expansion which began a fortnight since.The uneasiness in financial and eommercia' circles, consequent npon the political agitations at the South, has at last affected the money market, and w e note a marked advance in rates since last week.

Of course the parties accepting these bills would expect to be paid for their risk; the cotton would have to be shipped to them at ten or twenty per cent below its market value, and the planter would have his re- medy for indemnity against the State. There are parties here already who are on the lookout for some such operation as this.

A t Charleston business of all kinds is suspended; and while the mercantile men ap- pear to be engrossed with considerations of Sags and cockades, a bill has been introduced into the Legislature to authorize the banks to suspend spede payments, and the credit of the Charleston banks is already gone.

It isnot likely that South Carolina, as an in-dependent State, could sell any bonds hereor. in London. The experience of theTexas bondholders would operate as aninsuperable bar to anyiuch negotiation.
