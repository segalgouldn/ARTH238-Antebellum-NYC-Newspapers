One of his favorite rscre- ations was listening to musiCj of which he was an in- dulgent critic, ana he contrived to be pleased and soothed by strains less artfully modulated than fastid- ious eare are apt to require.His facility in writing and the charm of his style were owing to very early practice, the reading of good authors and the native elegance of hi* mind; and not, in my 'opinion, owing to any epecial study of the graces of manner or a n y anxious care m the use of terms and phrases- Words and combinations of words are Eometimss found in his writings to which a fas-tidious taste might object; but these do not prevent his style from being one of the most agreeabli in the whole range of our literature.

Irving did not aspire to be a taeologian, bat his heart was deeply penetrated with the better part of religion, and he had. sought humbly to imitate the example of the Grea', Teacher of Oorfauh. ., ,Tlat amiable character which makes itaelf so mam- feet in the writings of Irving, was seen in.all his daily actions. 'He-was ever ready to oo kind offices, tender of »he feelings of ohers, carefully jast, but ever lean- ing to the merciful side of j ostice, averse from Btrife, and so moceet that the world never ceased to wonderhow it should have happened that one so much praised should hive gained so li'tle assurance.

H i s h ibits of composition were, however, by nomeansregular. Whonhewasinthevein,theperiods would literally stream from his pen; a t other times he" would scarcely write anything. F o r two years after the failure of his brothers a t Liverpool, h e found it almost impossible to write a line. H e was throughout life an early riser, snd, when In the mood, would wr«te all the morning and till late i n the day,wholly engrossed with his subject. In the evening he was ready for any cheerful pastime, i n which h e took part-with an animation almost amounting to high spirits. These intervals of excitement and intense labor, sometimes lasting for weeks, were succeeded by languor, and a t times by depression of spirits, and for months the pen would lie untouched; even to answer a lette* a t those times was an irksome task.In the evening'he wrote but very rarely, knowing— so, at least, I ruler—that no habit makes severer de- mands uptn t h e nervous system tnan this. I t wasewing, I doubt not, to this prudent husbanding of hispowers, along wi h his somewhat abstinent habits andthe exercise which he took every day, that he wasable to preserve unimpaired to so late a period the fac-ulties employed in original composition.
