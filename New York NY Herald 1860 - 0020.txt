Tbe means to pay these expenses were also provided, and are Supplied by the permanent revenue and a fixed tax, which has already been levied, and will be collected during tbe ensuing winter and spring. The Comptroller has estimated $60,000 for miscellaneous appropriations, payable during tbe current year, la addition to those already made, and yet there will be a surplus on the 1st of October next of the above sum of $179,41312.This is the first instance for many years that the Gene- ral Fund revenue has been in a condition to pay all de- mands upon it and leave a surplus in tbe treasury. ,As satisfactory as the condition of this fund now ap- pears, the Comptroller is not without apprehension, from psst experience, that tbe Legislature may essentially cbabge it by heW spprepriaUohl. The Comptroller is not aware of any necessity which will justify appro- priations beyond the estimates here presented ; but it is not to be expected that the Legislature of 1860 will be exempt from the importunities to which other similar bodies have been subjected.

The great object of excluding from the ballot box ag illegal votes has been substantially attained, so that every elector may be sure that be can exert his due influence in the choice of rulers. Some few amendments to thw*mur are however needed. The registers already prepared should be the basis of thoseusedstfutureelections,buttheregistering board should meet prior to each election, aad, after hearing testimony, add the names of legal voters not already on them, and erase those not rightfully there. A bat showing only those added aad those stricken off should then bo prepared and pubBshed.
