Be- • fare doing so, however, I will notice some mattersWhich"(have been urged before meas grounds for grant- isg this motion. . .Chr6eh*lf of the city, the Corporation has examined •t-lenorth the proceedings of the Commissioncra of the I^uad'Ofitee in granting the lease of the premises orig- maiiv to Taylor and Breonan, the lessees, aod impugn- ing-Cieir motives both on account of the small amount• «f-reat to he paid and the haste with which the grant was madfc. ,In reference to that, it is sufficient to say that, with • iacb nrcveedJngs, I have nothing to do on this motion; whether the Commissioners did or did not honestly and "• fakhi'uLlv discharge their duties, is a matter between feem and the State. If the price received by them for 1 fee lease was inadequate, tho State, and not the Courts, 1* to call them to account. If there was any fraud in i staking tlm grant, or if the lease was void as prohib- ited hy law, or for any other cause, such matters may >e grounds of defense in the action, but are"not to be- examined in these motions.' The State must protect its own right* apainst ita own#9BBcers, and" it matters nothing to the City of New- York, in, resisting claims to tliia property, Uiatalease has be#n given to Taylor aud Brenuan by the Com- sawsioners for a sum far below its value. Such a 'defecie would form no ground for their claim to the fossession of the land, if they could shew no title there- to better than the State had, and that title was to beexamined and ascertained on. the trial of the cause.Por this reason, also, I do not deem it within my «raty on this motion to examine who hod the real title,fe this property, or whether the State-owned it or the •easy. Such ^questions must necessarily be examined and decided in a more formal aod dehberate manner "feau could he done on the motion, and-they have been examined and decided vrhen this cause was tried. That decision shall only \>e reviewed onappeal if there t «re no reasons for opening the judgments iu the othergrounds upon which this motion is baaed.I refer in*these remarks to th« suggestions which s^wwe made Offore me by most of the counsel, as to thevdaioas urged on both sides as to the right of each to hwM the Btune.•lJ£may become necessary hereafter to inquire as to fee authority of the Commissioners in other respects, a» to matters involved in the controversy; but oi that I will not speak now.Tftese views, above expressed, also render it proper 1tft me to add that, in the decision of these motions, I heve nothing to do with the consequences of IO-JS that Might follow to the city, if the judgments should be •pened, ox the gain if the judgments are guttered tobis client. (Beardeley agt. Root, 11 J. R., 464.) He has no authority to discharge the defendant from cus- tody on any execution without receiving payment. (Simonton agt. Banell, 21 Wendell, 362.)In Turhune agt. Colton, 2 Stockton R. 21. the Chan- cellor of New-Jersey says: " I think that the Solicitor had not the power to enter int6 an agreement by which the lien of his client was poatponed to a subsequent incumbrance. Toe authorities are numerous/and very uniform against fee authority of an attorney to enter into an argument of this kind, without being author- ized." (See also Williams agt. Smith, 1 Dowl. Pr. Cns. 632; Hubbard agt. Phillips, 18 M. &. W., 702.)In Howe agt. Lawrence, 2d Zabrissie, New-Jersey Rep., p. i>9, it was held that such an agreement made by an atorney or counsel, of matters no* necessarily connected with fee conducting of fee case, would not be sustained.The stipulations in-feat ca9e were somewhat of the same character as those in this ease, excepting that the intent was to allow another trial instead of preventing any review by the higher Court.StanburgDeGx'-sey, Gus Thomson ChnrcFi, G.
