Count 2ky, tbe leader of tho old Conservative party, telk the Emperor that the restoration of Austria to her ancient power k conditional upon the restora- tion of free institutions to. Hungary. The people are a!lassuming,withostentationtbenationalcostume; the Protestants are tbrnsting themselves forward for persecution; Franck Joseph has succeeded, by his ob- stinacy and bigotry, ia alienating the affections of^ a people who only requi/ed fair treatment to be the prop oi his Empire, and he haa, at the same time, jby tbe exhibition of hw weakness, encouraged tbem1 to set his authority at naught. Where will all this erid ? It k only to a certain point that a Conservative Power can rely upon other Conservative Powers to save it] in its utmost need.
