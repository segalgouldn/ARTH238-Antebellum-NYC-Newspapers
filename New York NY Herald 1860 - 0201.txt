Ha wished toea- presa ha grattneation m many regards. Tn the whole rise bhd progrsaa of this discuestdn, he had felt that there was great necessity for such a stirring up of UM church.

Mr. Boscher then paid a high com- pliment to Mr. Tappan, and oontinuei to urge the import- ance of his position, and the great responsibility dc-tol-ringapon him as the pastor of the church.

Where a man is put in a hign repreeent<uive position, a great responsibility devolve*upon him, and as such be is entitled to more confidence. His views tn regard to the question now before the church were very plain, jln the first place, he was firmly persuaded mat the American Board of Foreign Missions was tbe beet depository for the funds of this church; ant secondly, while he was anxiousto employ that agency, he >lid not wish to draw anything from the American Missionary Association, but oh the contrary, if a proposition to raise a collection in this cbarch tn behalf of that society be brought up Inf o r m h e w o u l d n o t b e d i s p o s e d t o o p p o s e , i t , a n d i n could not do so without violating his conscience.
