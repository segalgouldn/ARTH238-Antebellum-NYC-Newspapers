The Water may also b e often used with advantage, he says, in cases of low Typhoid Fe- vers; in convalescence from protracted fevers, to excite the ap- petite and promote digestion; in 'Diarrheas, particularly such as are dependent on a relaxed o r ulcerated state of t!he mucouB membrane of the intestines. I n Calculous affectionj, or Lithia- sis, attended wiihphosphatic sediments, it is the suitable remedy! being preferable to muriatic acid, a* being more solvent and losa apt by continued use to disorder the stom«ch.

I n Skin Disease*—in those forms o f Dyspepsia connected with an alkaline condition of the stomach; as in Pyrosis, or Water-Brash, it wiR prove better than hydro- chloric acid. In cases of Couca Pictouum, and other injurious consequences arising from, the action of lead, this Water wiR prove to be an admirable antidote.
