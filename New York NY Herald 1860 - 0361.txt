South western buyers a/e m tne market; and the representatives of Mitsoun, Kentucky and Tennessee houses have beea making purchases. Blocks of all des crlpUuns of goods are in good supply. City jobbers are still buying; and there is a considerable discrepancy be twern tne news of importers and buyers as to prices, which restricts transactions. Fancy su_1 are in chief de- mand, and desirable si> lee comasana ready sale. I/>w graces 01 lancy and p_an stlki> are dull and heavy. Miiu nery goods and ribbons move a Utile. Woollens are acuv only wniran concession a made from asking prices. Tntsis particularly the case with Belgian goods. Fancy cnasi meres of m e preralling styles sell well, but other kinds are dull. Drees goods generally are in request, linond are active. In1 domestics the spring styles are e_ moreastd demand. Cotton staple Ubno* arc firm. Tbe export de- mand lor Inant and China is very large. Prints have bo come active and bu jjant in price. Tno supply of foreign woollens interferes greatly with the tnarkot tor domssttos,and the expcciauou of a lower range of prices from a &u pcrabuadenoe of supply checks a good demand.
