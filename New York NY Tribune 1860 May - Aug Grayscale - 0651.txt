To this Con- vention, Mr. C . T . ChaBe of Chicago made a report of his travels and personal observations among the em- bryo schools of our country, which wefindreported inThe Chicago Tribune, as follows:I first visited Cincinnati with a view of visiting theFarmers' College in that vicinity, but on learning from several intelligent' gentlemen of the city that it was strictly a literary institution, a n d made b u t little pre- tensions even to teaching those branches,which have a decided bearing on agriculture,! did not visit it, but proceeded to Washington and had a very satisfactory interview with Prof. James Henry and Prof. Boin, Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. These gentlemen manifested much inter- est in the movement in this State, furnished me with what inforajationjthey were in possession of, and ten- dered the cooperation of the Institution.The State of Maryland has an Agricultural College at Bladensburgh, seven miles out of Washington. ThiB institution went into operation nine months ago, under thodirection of a Board of Trustees. They 1 ave a Professor of Mathematics, of Chemistry, of the AncientatdModernLanguages,andan Entomologist who is pursuing h'S investigations there and preparing a t e x t - b o o k o n t h e s u b j e c t .

The College was established by- act of the Maryland Legislature, March 5; 185o. $25,000 was raised by private subscription, and the State made a permanent appropriation of $6,000 annu- ally for the endowment of the institution. A farm of 428 acres of land was purchased, and a building erect- ed of 120 feet by 54 feet, 5 stories high, a t a n expense of about $25,000. The accommodations are considered• sufficient for about 120 boarders, There are a farm- house'and out-buMings Onthe place, occupied by the Register pf the Board of Trustees, who is the business manager. An annual endowment of $2,500 per year for three years has also been made by a wealthy gen- tleman. The institution is laboring under some pecu- niary embarrassment, and difficulties of a serious and unfortunate nature have arisen between tbe Trusteesand the Faculty respecting t h e detail of its manage-ment, which have somewhat impaired its efficiency.misapprehension as to his own motives, he would also etate that he had the offer of a position in thatiUniver- sity which, he wOuld probably accept, and that while the Profeesorship tendered him was in another part of the institution, he would be expected to take some humble part in the management of the Agricultural Department. The institution has a commodious build- i r g completed, six professorships already filled, a libe- ral endowment, and will soon start an experimental farm at a convenient distance from the city. . Lands have been offered by the liberality of citizens in two or three directions from the city, and will be accepted at sone one of the points on the^ line of some railroad. Good soils of several varieties can be secured onfarm of 200 acres, at any one of the points undersideration. The farm will be put under the manage-ment of the best agricultural tutors of the country.Professorships appropriate to an agricultural coll< re ofiextnmorning, were from i to £ per cent lower.

Now, you must know, Mr. Horace Greeley, how calumnious this imputation IB. You muet know that; if my course could bo influ- enced by ambitious motives, the inducements presented by the Republican party were abundantly ample for the purpose. There are those who can testily how many proffers I have rejected, and that, rather than espouse a cauee which failed to secure the sanction of my conscience, I preferred voluntary banishment from public life. Your reflections on my position and course in this Presidential election aro .equally unjust and un- manly. Orce for all,' I ftigmatize your assertions that I have abandoned my own candidates, or intend to saciifice their intereBts in favor of other candidates, or thatIproposetosellandtransfervotes,asgrosslyuntrue and libelous.

You must know that the course which I prooose is the only one by which I can effectually contribute to secure their election. On this subject Ihave no disguise. Ipreferany other Constitutional method of electing the President to a choice made by Electoral Colleges, choHen by one section of the Union only, and by only a third of tbe American people*. To avert this list result, I am ready to unite with National men of every shade to carry the final decision to the House of Representatives, whose members are sa much electedby the people as the mem- bers of the Electoral Colleges. Not that I consider this mode of election desirable under ordinary circuoi- stances; but I hold, and am ready to maintain, that it is preferable to an election which, however Constitu- tional in form, is utterly unconstitutional in spirit, made by the stronger geographical section combined against the weaker, on questions pertaining chiefly to the do- mestic policy of the weaker States,In the present state of things' we are reduced to a choice of evils, and I would take that which I conceive-to be the least. I wish now to see a direct vote by the Peo- ple of this State on the naked issue whether New-York shall b e one of a mere geographical combination, o r shall maintain a National attitude in her relationsto the Government of the Union. ??You assume that if the election is given to the House, either Breckinridge or Lane will be made President.
