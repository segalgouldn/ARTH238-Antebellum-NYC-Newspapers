On these re- presentations I at once cheerfully loaned him the money. The note, not being stamped as required by Uw. proved worthless. Shortly after tins Harlan attended the Don- easter Races, and became broke, betting on the horse Promised Land. Here I asked of him payment of his •vote, which h e declined t o do, saying that his losses h a t "broke" him; but as b e wished me to realise my money, be requested me, in presence of L K. Carpenter, Esq , to take from bis stable the horse Jack Rossiter, or any other property there, out of which I could realize my money1 went to Newmarket. Soon Bell, Harlan'* trainer, rode Jack Rossiter into the yard, and iBnu«*li;.t.-'y a boy of Harlan's came in, saying that tbe bailiff was at the stable seizing Harlan's property. A Mr. McLaughlin, who was present, advised me to lake possession of Jack Roasi ter s t once, as directed b y Harlan, to cover my claim, Mr. Bali saying a t once that b e would deliver the h »rse to me, preferring that 1 should b e secured before othergrocery store of Frederick Scaling, No. 47 Mou.su* street.
