They think the economy of labor resulting from the use of steam as a motive power would dis- eniploy a large portion of their population, and only tend to complicate their civilization, while many of them look upon a wide extension of their commercial relations with foreign coun- tries as likely to increase their liability to be- come involved in the calamity of war, and eventually lead to the overthrow of the empire.
