CoLi, of the Flora Temple, in his letter to Mr. Masct, says ; "My tostructlons from toe owners of the ship directed me to carrv passengers from this port to Havana.

The large clipper, the Norway, now loaded with coal on Govern- ment account, as soon as *he unloads Is to proceed to Swatow, it Is said, and take on two thousand cool- ies, already prepared."March 11, 1S59, Mr. Attorney-General Black gave his opinion that| tbe coolle-trade did not come witoto the provision of the Acts of Congress before alluded to ; and that there was no remedy for the evil but by the interference of Congress.At a later date Mr. It EiD writes toat "a new Impetus has been given to the coolie trade. and|ihat traffickers are becomtog more organized ; the Spanish autoori- ttes have rtmoved aU restraints upon it, and the Frercb Government are organizing an extensive scheme of Chtoese emigration to Algiers and toe WestIndiancolonies.
