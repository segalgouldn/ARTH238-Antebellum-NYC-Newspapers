Their sale, inexpedient at any time, even ifpermittedbytheConstitution, wouldbe doubly ao at a period when, by unwise legislation and un- centrolled competition, their revenuea have been reduced to the lowest point, and when their com- pMien, how so soon to be realized, yiOl enable us toreapthe ftuits of the aacrificesandexpendi-seven dollars snd forty-six cents at Auburn, and three thousand nine hundred and fifty-six dollars and thirty-six cents at Clinton.The eaminga during the same period were :tures Mtberto made.

I stronglyntge that this be done, even if it should be neces- sary to delay the opening for the passage of boats a few days longer than ordinary.The amount of interest on the debt which theLegislature has^nnuaHy to provide is as follows : Oaths newCanal Debtof$12,000,000, con-'tractedla 18M $710,000 00 On the Geaeral Fund Debt, cbarge^le toibeSloUng FundOn the sev^al loans contracted to meetcasual deficits for Canal purposesOn School and Gospel Fund for Stock-kridge Indians.3M,M)Ç 10 M,S2I) 28 2,180 00Total Èl,iei,ÇÈ 38 The interest on the old canal debt is providedfor by the surplus revenues of the Canals, but, under the Constitution, what remuns of those revenues after paying such interest goes to the sinking fund for the redemption of the principal. The law under which the recent loan of two mil- linna five hundred thousand dollars was made, pro- vides for the levying of a tax suiGcient to pay the interest and the contribution to the sinking fund to redeem the principal.There is then needed :Foe tlw oempletloa ofthe canals tl,U8,9Ç9 37 For the peymaat of Interest on the debtndtotnerwlBe provided for 1,101,393 38 For the expenses of Government beyondss'ttmatea permanent revenue 1 ,200,000 00Total ¥3,È60.JM 7SOf the amount needed to complete the canals,however, not more than one-half Çan be advan-tageouslyexpended,duringtheyear.

Npw-York possesses resources and revenues, independentlv of taxation, which are adequate to the payment of the interest and prin- ciple of all her existing debts, if not to the support of her Government, and it only requires a just and faithful administration of her affairs to secure that result;Trior to the year 1844 there were great differ- ences in the positibn of the railroads with refer- ence to the transportation of merchandise. While some of them were allowed to carry it during the enflre year without limitation, others were per- mitted to do so only when the canals were closed snd on payment of tolls, while one, at least, wa:i absolutely forbidden to carry freight at all. In 1844, however, an ajiproach to a more uniform systeta was made by giving to all roads thai did not Mefvlonsly possess it the right to transport &eighti)oriag the suspension of canal navigation, and bj^tei^inng all the railroads along the line of theEmandOswegocanals topaythesamerates per mUe on freight transported over them as it wouldhavepaid'ifcarriedonthecanals. In1847 all railroads along the central line were permitted to carry freight the entire 'year, and required to pay tpUs. .In 1 850 the sam* provisions were, by the general railroad act, made applicable to aU railroads miming parallel to and within thirty miles Çf any osnal. In 1851 all tolls were abol- ished upon freight carried over railroads, under the expectation that the revenues from the en- larged canaU would prove adequate to the pay- ment of toe intereat upon the canal debt.Duifaui the time that tolls were imposed upon tks ratttqads, the amount received from them by thtf State steadily increased from ten thousand, four li6ndred and |ifty-eight dollars and forty-four cents, ; In. 184£, to one hundred and sixty-three thoDsand',. two hundred and thirty-seven dollars aiÈdtimljcents.In1861.
