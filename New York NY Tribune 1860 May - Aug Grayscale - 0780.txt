'Judge William Kent must find h;mself among strange bed-fellows on the Douglas Electoral ticket. He was formerly a Whig, then a Seward Whig, and then a non- Seward Whig. Then, w e think, he became a Republican, so far, a t least, as to vote the Fremont ticket in 1860. Of late he has professed, we are told, to be a Believerett, o r Union m a n . A n d now, suddenly, to the surprise of his friends, he turns up in this unexpected manner, a s a Douglas Democrat. I s it possible there can be any mistake about it ?
