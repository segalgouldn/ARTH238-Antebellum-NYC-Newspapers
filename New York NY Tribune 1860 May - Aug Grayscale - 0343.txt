Hamlin voted to insert a tdmUar rt- siriction m the bills orginizing Utah and New-Mexico, wad that measure failing, 'voted agaiost the bills organ- izing those Territories without Slavery prohibition, and in so doing he obeyed the explicit instructions of the Democratic Legislature of Maine." In 1850, also, Mr. liaxnlin's voice was the first raised in the United States Senate for the unqualified, unconditional admbeio/i of California as a Frr.c State, and me speech on this question was one of the ablest delivered during that session of Congress.Capital stock of Telegraph CompanyChpital stock of Newark and Bloomfield RR, Co...
