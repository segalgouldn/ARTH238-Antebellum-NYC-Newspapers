Mr.Bryanwasattended on the ground by Mr. Meredith, of Philadelphia, and Mr. Nealoby Mr.GeorgeBowdon,ofNewYork. Theentire party, w e understand, left for home yesterday—Mr. Neale's wound n o t incapacitating h im from travelling. The cause of th e quarrel, which is said to have taken place at the Union Club, in New York, grew out of a heat- ed discussion between the parties respecting the nation- ality of the Italian patriot Garibaldi. A difference of opinion onthis point led to words,and then,toa blow from Mr. Neale, and a subsequent challenge from Mr. Bryan. Mr. Bryan is between sixty and seventy yearsCITY COMMERCIAL REPORT.
