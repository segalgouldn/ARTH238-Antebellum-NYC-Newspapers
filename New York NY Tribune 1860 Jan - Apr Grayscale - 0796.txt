It brought the nominal price of $100,000,thesalebeing merely proforma,inorderto carryoutthedecreeoftheSupreme Court, theactof the Legislature, and the agreement between the vari- ous interests of the Company.We learn from Philadelphia that the prospects are that the tonnage of the Beading Bailroad for the pre- sent week will reach 40,000 tuns, against 27,000 tuns for the corresponding week of 1859. A Philadelphia paper says:" The business of the road looks flattering in the extreme. The coal tunnage for the last five weeks has increased to the enormous item of 60,000 tons, and it is confidently expected that the average increase per •week will Dot be less than 10,000 tuna from this time forward to the end of the year, making over two millions of tone of coal for the year 1860. This extra- ordinary increase will be equal to 1856,, when the ttockwasselling at $46pershare. We anticipate soon thatitwillrequirenobullingtoputthisstockto muchhigher figures.
