They will not only decide the future character of our relations with that country, but they may exercise some in- fluence over the campaign of 1860. In the shufflings and boltings of the political tricksters at the Charleston Convention, they may be made the means of defeating organized Ireachery. and of imparting cohesion and union to the democratic ranks.

There was a general attendance. All out skiers, including clerks, doorkeepers and reporters, were excluded, and every precaution adopted to prevent their proceedings from being known.Mr. IJttlejohn was in the chair. A warm discussion took place, and tt was evident in the commencement that they could not harmonize on tbe question of tolling rail- roads. A number of the republicans immediately flew from the track the moment that t h e subject was men- tioned. Speeches were made at some length by Messrs. Conkling, Hammond, Ramsay, Miller, Ltttlejohn, But- ler, and several others, the tenor of which was that a tax had got to be raised in some way. The State Treasury w a s empty, and fit devolved upon them, a s representatives of the dominant party, to decide uponcargo, was lost on the 16th Inst, on the coast of Texas.

On the one hand, the North- ern democrats are exceedingly anxious to carry at lent one New England State, so that they maystandfairlyatCharleston.Ontheother side, the republicans are very well aware that they have no States to throw away, and that should their Eastern Malakoff be taken, or even one of its outposts battered down, they cannot depend upon either of the Central States. The republicaas have serious doubts as to their Connecticut adherents, and spare no pains nor expense to bring out their full vote. The democrats areworking upon the manufacturing interest, which has begun to see the folly of the doctrines inculcated by Helper and Seward. The democrats know very well that the breeches pocket is the tenderest part of the wooden nut- meg ^tate. and they are working upon thatby all the representatives of the people.The State Comptroller and Canal Auditor were calledupon togive their views, both of whom pictured the finances of t h e State in a dilapidated condition, a n d thoughtItthedutyoftheLegislaturetodecideuponsome mode for a revenue before they passed a n y bills appro- priatingmoneyforpublicworks.Mr.Ramsaythought that if any vote was taken there to night It should not b e binding on them, as tar as the Albany and Susquehanna Railroadisconcerned,andotherpubhehneasures.
