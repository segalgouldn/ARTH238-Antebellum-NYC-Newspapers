When that smtty, which is geternJly found to exist even between nationi foriIgn to each other, ceases to exist between confederated States; when those comities, which enlight eced nations dellghi to extend to each other, are refused to sister States by members of a fraternal confederacy; when rectiocal strife and crimination usurp tbe place of charity sad kiadnees la the hear ta of a confederated pee pie; when hatred and defamation mark all the relationsbetween neighbors and {partners, then separation be- comes not only tbe natural and rightful, but the tnevlta ble resort.
