This was not wholly unexpect- ed , as the merchants of Memphis and Kaoxvffle have been sonwriag severely tor thewantofbankaccommodation. Therealsource of the trouble in that, as inis the failure ef the corn crop, which has crippled trade. It need hardly be added that theaion ef the Tennessee banks will not make any ma- terial difference to the general trade of the country. From New Orleans we hear that sight bills on New Yorkaredownto4a| premium,anindicationthat the cotton movement is reviving. The private let- ters from New Orleans are more cheerful, and con- fidence is expressed in the ability of the banks to n i a I n themselves. From Mobile, and from seve- ral points in Mississippi and Georgia, the ad- vice* are very gloomy; trade is at an end, the currency is depreciated, the stock of food is run- ningdown,andthepeoplehavenomeanstobay more; to these States tike idea of secession seems to he adopted by many as a desperate remedy for intolerable evils. A bank director of Charleston, 8. C , writes us to confirm tike telegraphicmeat that the South Carolina banks will notpond. His letter was written apparently beforetint suspension of tike Formers' Bank. He addsthat Sooth Carolina will produce this year 250,000bales of upland cotton, which, with the long cot-ton, rico, turpentine, & c , yielded b y that Slate,will be worth «25.ooo,000-allor which, ho adds,wi& have to be paid for in coin by the purchasersat the Norm and to Europe. At this rate South with the goods accumulating on their hands, and Carolina is going to be very rich in specie, and onecannot but wonder at the shortsighted policy oftike directors of the Boom Carolina Baah-oad, who,fat the face of so glowing a prospect, hove just dis-charged one hundred hands. We need hardly saythat we are delighted to hear that the prospects oftike old Palmetto State are so cheering. An idea# 1 prevail here that business was not so pros-perous at Charleston and hi the interior as thefriends of the Statemight have wished; the report-ers of the Associated Prom, even, have been sofar misled astospeakof a severefinancialpres-sure at Charleston If, aa oar correspondentwrites, the State is about to toko $25,000,000 inspecie from the Rortik and from Europe, why anthese stories moat be set down an calumnies, andthe prospect of collecting Northern debts toSouth Carolina must be pronounced far better thanto generally expected.ATirTfheBK. ....

Of all the South- ern States tBawawppi suffered tike moat fromtdrought thissummer. Com is nowselling at es which are absolutely ranoos to the planter: since the recent derangement of the currency, supply, even at oxhorbitont prices, has boon almost cut off. Southern dealers cannot buy corn with Southern currency for that is depreciated be- yond measure, and wffl hardly be token at all in the West; nor can they get gold to buy it with, forthe recent panic has stopped the movement of cotton, put up exchange ou the North and checked the flow of specie Bouthward. A leading citizen of Mississippi writes that while the Oongrornkmal delegation of that State are diverting themselves by meeting to devise dJannioniat schemes, the planters and men of business are concerting mea- sures to bo laid before the Legislature, in the hope of averting the famine which la now imminent. If relief be not afforded, he adds, by 1st February, there will not be found enough intikeState to feed the slaves, and the possible consequences are ap- palling to contemplate. Wo are lad to believe that the condition of other cotton States— a labama, Georgia and Booth Carolina -is not much better than that of Mississippi, though in toe present fierce politicalexcitement this reallymuch more vital matter is overlook* d\ W e would submit that thesearecircumstanceswhich call for actionon the part of the North. It is just as important to prevent the impending famine in ear sister States oftheSouthasitwastoavertthe threatenedsus-pension of specie payments by the banks of New York city.

The State Auditor has determined not to prom his demand upon toe banks for more securi- ty. The quotation of sight exchange on New York at 5 a 6 per cent discount doea not neeeasarily imply a cessation of business; it merely means that the depreciated currency of Illinois has fallen so much below the specie standard.The business of the Sub-Treasuary to-day was as follows:—••«•••**>#••••»••••••••%•••••••••* ' ••••••••••••••••••••••»••»«•*•>•see* ssift* •••••••eeeee*»a*a».4MUM4i The directors of the Little Miami Baflroad Com- pany have declared a dividend of four per cent forIn relation to Messrs.
