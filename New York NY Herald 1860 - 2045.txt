Tanas Harrs, lnd., July 38. lASO.Thus, allowing the old line whigs and Ameri- cans a free course for their ticket of Bell and Everett, and making liberal allowances for American and democratic deserters, we see that It is only necessary for the two wings of the democracy to unite in order to carry Pennsyl- vania by a plurality of at least ten thousand over Lincoln.Let the democracy of Pennsylvania, and of every other Northern State, unite upon a com- mon electoral ticket, and Lincoln may be hand- somely defeated. The South will vote solid for Breckinridge. California and Oregon will fol- low suit. The vote of Pennsylvania, then, will only be required to settle the question against Lincoln; and there is every reason among pa- triotic men for every sacrifice of party or per- sonal preferences to accomplish this result The factious instructions of soured and reckless party managers should be disregarded, and the masses of the democracy should make the de- feat of Lincoln their first duty and their para- mount object.Put this republican party into the White House, and before it can be ousted it may com- pass the control of every department of the fe- deral government Then, the republican doc- trine of negro equality would be apt to assume a shape so revolting as to "precipitate the South into a revolution/' the terrible consequences of which would defy all human calculations.

The very troops of the gorern- ment not only sympathize, but lend a helping hand in the work of slaughter.These facts show that important political events are at hand in Turkey. The greet Euro- pean Powers, who calmly looked on while Haynau and Radetzsky and Windischgratz—the butchers of Austria—slaughtered their fellow Christians in thousands in 1848 and 1849—and one of which Powers actually assisted them in the bloody business—while Bomba, of Na- ples, kept his executioners busily employed ia chopping off Christian heads, without being guilty of any offence save patriotism—should not be surprised if the simple, unsophisticated Druses imitated their example. Before the great Powers undertake to wipe out Turkey because she will not, or cannot, keep her subjects from shedding Christian blood, they ought to bring Austria and Naples to account, and wipe them out of existence, if Christians had set a better example to the heathen there might be some reason for a new crusade of Christendom against the Turks. But it is positirely asserted that the origin of these massacres was the or- ganization of a Christian expedition against the capital cf the Druses. The Christians ought, therefore, to take the beam out of their owntitude.T h e G r e a t E m a t e r n . 7 Contrary to expectation, the closing day of thexGreat Eastern was not signalized by as large^a throng asilUurax, July 3d.
